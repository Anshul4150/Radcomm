      "Introduction\n",
      "This Technical Specification has been produced by 3GPP TSG SA to allow for the standardization in the area of lawful interception of telecommunications. This document addresses the handover interfaces for lawful interception of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The specification defines the handover interfaces for delivery of lawful interception Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.\n",
      "Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g. European Union), and sometimes licensing and operating conditions define a need to intercept telecommunications traffic and related information in modern telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawful interception shall always be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Nothing in this specification, including the definitions, is intended to supplant national law.\n",
      "This specification should be used in conjunction with TS 33.106 [18] and TS 33.107 [19] in the same release. This specification may also be used with earlier releases of TS 33.106 [18] and TS 33.107 [19], as well as for earlier releases of UMTS and GPRS.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\tScope\n",
      "The present document specifies the handover interfaces for Lawful Interception (LI) of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the UMTS network and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The handover interface in this context includes the delivery of Intercept Related Information (IRI) through the Handover Interface 2 (HI2) and Content of Communication (CC) through the Handover Interface 3 (HI3) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF).\n",

      "identity: technical label which may represent the origin or destination of any telecommunications traffic, as a rule clearly identified by a physical telecommunications identity number (such as a telephone number) or the logical or virtual telecommunications identity number (such as a personal number) which the subscriber can assign to a physical access on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "interception: action (based on the law), performed by a network operator / access provider / service provider, of making available certain information and providing that information to a law enforcement monitoring facility.\n",
      "NOTE 2:\tIn the present document the term interception is not used to describe the action of observing communications by a law enforcement agency.\n",
      "interception configuration information: information related to the configuration of interception.\n",
      "interception interface: physical and logical locations within the network operator's / access provider's / service provider's telecommunications facilities where access to the content of communication and intercept related information is provided. The interception interface is not necessarily a single, fixed point.\n",
      "interception measure: technical measure which facilitates the interception of telecommunications traffic pursuant to the relevant national laws and regulations.\n",
      "intercept related information: collection of information or data associated with telecommunication services involving the target identity, specifically communication associated information or data (e.g. unsuccessful communication attempts), service associated information or data and location information.\n",

      "internal network interface: network's internal interface between the Internal Intercepting Function and a mediation device.\n",
      "invocation and operation: describes the action and conditions under which the service is brought into operation; in the case of a lawful interception this may only be on a particular communication. It should be noted that when lawful interception is activated, it shall be invoked on all communications (Invocation takes place either subsequent to or simultaneously with activation.). Operation is the procedure which occurs once a service has been invoked.\n",
      "NOTE 3:\tThe definition is based on ITU-T Recommendation X.882 [8], but has been adapted for the special application of lawful interception, instead of supplementary services.\n",
      "law enforcement agency: organization authorized by a lawful authorization based on a national law to request interception measures and to receive the results of telecommunications interceptions.\n",
      "law enforcement monitoring facility: law enforcement facility designated as the transmission destination for the results of interception relating to a particular target.\n",

      "network operator: operator of a public telecommunications infrastructure which permits the conveyance of signals between defined network termination points by wire, by microwave, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means.\n",
      "precision: the number of digits with which a numerical value is expressed, e.g. the number of decimal digits or bits. Note: precision should not be confused with accuracy, which is a difference between a measured/recorded numerical value and the respective value in the standard reference system.\n",
      "quality of service: quality specification of a telecommunications channel, system, virtual channel, computer-telecommunications session, etc. Quality of service may be measured, for example, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, bit error rate, message throughput rate or call blocking probability.\n",
      "reliability: probability that a system or service will perform in a satisfactory manner for a given period of time when used under specific operating conditions.\n",
      "result of interception: information relating to a target service, including the content of communication and intercept related information, which is passed by a network operator, an access provider or a service provider to a law enforcement agency. Intercept related information shall be provided whether or not call activity is taking place.\n",

      "service provider: natural or legal person providing one or more public telecommunications services whose provision consists wholly or partly in the transmission and routing of signals on a telecommunications network. A service provider needs not necessarily run his own network.\n",
      "SMS: Short Message Service gives the ability to send character messages to phones. SMS messages can be MO (mobile originate) or MT(mobile terminate).\n",
      "target identity: technical identity (e.g. the interception's target directory number), which uniquely identifies a target. One target may have one or several target identities.\n",
      "target service: telecommunications service associated with an target and usually specified in a lawful authorization for interception.\n",
      "NOTE 4:\tThere may be more than one target service associated with a single target.\n",

The inner circle contains the internal functions of the network (e.g. switching, routing, handling of the communication process). Within the network internal function the results of interception (i.e. IRI and CC) are generated in the Internal Interception Function (IIF).\n",

This protocol is defined by IETF RFC 2126: \"ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)\" [28] on the application layer and the BER on the presentation layer. The lower layers for data communication may be chosen in agreement with the operator (NO/AN/SP) and the LEA.\n",

Where possible, the format of the information content shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used for these parameters with the network already (e.g. IP). Within the ASN.1 coding for IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet strings.\n",

      "4)\tIRI-REPORT record\tused in general for non-communication related events.\n",
      "For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1 to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI transaction for each communication case or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication phase (set-up, active or release).\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, the first event of a communication attempt shall be the PDP context activation or a similar event and an IRI-BEGIN record shall be issued. The end of the communication attempt shall be the PDP context deactivation and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records, IRI-REPORT records otherwise.\n",
      "Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like subscriber controlled input (SCI) for service activation. For simple cases, it can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. It can also be applicable to report some subscriber actions which may trigger communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication, when the communication attempt or the change of the existing communication itself is reported separately.\n",
      "Record type 4 is also used to convey the LALS reports.\n",
      "For the IMS domain the IRI record types are used in a different way than described in this clause. Details on the IRI type usage in the IMS domain are defined in clause 7.5.\n",
      "The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are defined independently of target communication events. The actual indication of one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI record, is part of further parameters within the record's information content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions are not related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication case, and are therefore independent of future enhancements of the intercepted services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information (i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target communication related information is contained within the information content of the IRI records.\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, if LI is being activated during an already established PDP context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an established PDP context or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can be communicated to the LEA by other means (e.g. HI1).\n",
      "NOTE:\tIn some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc, intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an interception is activated on an already established PDP context or similar.\n",
      "The DF2 shall not send the BEGIN with Start of Interception to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the target communication due to a previous LI activation on the same target.\n",

      "4.6\tReliability\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of the interception of the content of communication should be (at least) equal to the reliability of the original content of communication. For intercepted packet data communications, this may be derived from the QoS class used for the original intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20].\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of interception of signalling should be (at least) equal to the the reliability of the original signalling.\n",

      "FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the mediation function (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries.\n",
      "\n",
      "A.2.2\tUsage of the FTP\n",
      "The MF acts as the FTP client and the LEMF acts as the FTP server . The client pushes the data to the server.\n",
      "The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The MF may buffer files.\n",
      "Several records may be gathered into bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency.\n",
      "The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms;\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.\n",
      "Every file shall contain only complete IRI records. The single IRI record shall not be divided into several files.\n",
      "There are two possible ways as to how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",
      "File naming:\n",
      "The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference).\n",
      "Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic through MF (as in method B).\n",
      "The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are \"a\"…\"z\", \"A\"…\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"…\"9\".\n",

      "seq =\tinteger ranging between [0..2^64-1], in ASCII form (not exceeding 20 ASCII digits), identifying the sequence number for file transfer from this node per a specific target.\n",
      "ext =\tASCII integer ranging between [\"1\"..\"8\"] (in hex: 31H…38H), identifying the file type. The possible file types are shown in table A.1. Type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and type \"8\" is reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept.\n",

With this method, the data sorting and interpretation tasks of the LEMF are considerably easier to facilitate in near real time than in alternative B.\n",
      "File naming method B):\n",
      "The other choice is to use monolithic fixed format file names (with no trailing file type part in the file name):\n",

      "This alternative B is used when several targets' intercepted data is gathered to common delivery files.

Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed.\n",
      "At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> & <leauser> -pair. Once the login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating 'mput' command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. 'pwd') can be sent every T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimised as possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent).\n",

A primitive is a pre-defined type (of class UNIVERSAL) and a constructor consists of other types (primitives or other constructors). A constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier alone. Both ends of a communication have to understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT types. EXPLICIT types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER would be tagged only with the Number tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the INTEGER tag within the Number tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT tagging for more compact message encoding.\n",
      "For the coding of the value part of each parameter the general rule is to use a widely use a standardized format when it exists (ISUP, DSS1, MAP, etc.).\n",
      "As a large part of the information exchanged between the user's may be transmitted within ISUP/DSS1 signalling, the using of the coding defined for this signalling guarantee the integrity of the information provided to the LEMF and the evolution of the interface. For example if new values are used within existing ISUP parameters, this new values shall be transmitted transparently toward the LEMF.\n",
      "For the ASN.1 parameters of the type 'OCTET STRING', the ordering of the individual halfoctets of each octet shall be such that the most significant nibble is put into bitposition 5 - 8 and the least significant nibble into bitposition 1 - 4. This general rule shall not apply when parameter formats are imported from other standards, e.g. an E.164 number coded according to ISUP, ITU-T Recommendation Q.763 [29]. In this case the ordering of the nibbles shall be according to that standard and not be changed.\n",

      "There are two possible ways how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",
      "The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams might also be delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2 and HI3 packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in the IRI and the CC packet streams.\n",

      "Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF\n",
      "This annex is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF.\n",
      "For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a target, it will be necessary for the LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP signaling (as provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media streams. The principal reason for this is that the SDP content within the SIP signaling may provide the information required to even be able to decode the media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP header within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to determine the specific encoding used. The SDP portion of the SIP signaling would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the SIP signaling provides information about the participants in a SIP session (other than the target) sending and receiving the associated media streams. The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of the IMS IRI and all of the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a single LIID is used in association all of the target's IMS identities (as per a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and GSN CC information is fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able to associate each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the CC.\n",
      "The SIP messsages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional items of information that could be relevant with respect to supporting correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and GSN CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is discussed below:\n",
      "-\tCall-ID, From tag, To tag : These SIP headers would identify different SIP messages belonging to the same SIP dialog (a call leg between the target user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is not sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with specific media streams is the principal objective of this discussion.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID): The principal purpose of the IMS Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to correlate charging information provided by different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be useful in correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog identifiers are modified (e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary for the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address): GCIDs, along with the GGSN address, may be used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) are made available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to correlate SIP messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this type of correlation would be useful, although not essential.\n",
      "SDP Connection addresses and ports: The address and port information within the SDP of the SIP messages need to be matched with the addresses and ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC reports. This implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as in the packets provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to simplify the search for a match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may also include essential information about the encoding of each of the media streams, without which it may not be possible to decode.\n",

At the HI2 interface, the \"LI application\" protocol is used directly over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for the delivery of the IRI. IP is defined in IETF STD0005 [15]. TCP is defined in IETF STD0007 [16].\n",

A TCP/IP connection shall be capable of transporting \"LI application\" messages for multiple surveillance cases to a single LEA. The MF initiates the establishment of TCP connections to the LEMF equipment designated by the LEA. Optionally, the MF may use more than one TCP connection per LEMF for the purpose of delivering \"LI application\" messages to minimize the effects of congestion or facility failures. For example, if more than one TCP connection was used \"LI application\" messages may be uniformly distributed across the connections. If delays are detected on one TCP connection, the MF could begin to transmit more messages on the other TCP connections. The number of TCP connections supported to the LEMF shall be less than or equal to the provisioned maximum number of such connections.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "This Technical Specification has been produced by 3GPPÂ TSGÂ SA to allow for the standardization in the area of lawful interception of telecommunications. This document addresses the handover interfaces for lawful interception of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The specification defines the handover interfaces for delivery of lawful interception Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.\n",
      "Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g. European Union), and sometimes licensing and operating conditions define a need to intercept telecommunications traffic and related information in modern telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawful interception shall always be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Nothing in this specification, including the definitions, is intended to supplant national law.\n",
      "This specification should be used in conjunction with TSÂ 33.106Â [18] and TSÂ 33.107Â [19] in the same release. This specification may also be used with earlier releases of TSÂ 33.106Â [18] and TSÂ 33.107Â [19], as well as for earlier releases of UMTS and GPRS.\n",

Where possible, the format of the information content shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used for these parameters with the network already (e.g. IP). Within the ASN.1 coding for IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet strings.\n",

      "3)\tIRI-Continue record\tat any time during a communication attempt\n",
      "\twithin the IRI transaction.\n",
      "4)\tIRI-REPORT record\tused in general for non-communication related events.\n",
      "For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1 to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI transaction for each communication case or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication phase (set-up, active or release).\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, the first event of a communication attempt shall be the PDP context activation or a similar event and an IRI-BEGIN record shall be issued. The end of the communication attempt shall be the PDP context deactivation and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records, IRI-REPORT records otherwise.\n",
      "Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like subscriber controlled input (SCI) for service activation. For simple cases, it can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. It can also be applicable to report some subscriber actions which may trigger communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication, when the communication attempt or the change of the existing communication itself is reported separately.\n",
      "Record type 4 is also used to convey the LALS reports.\n",
      "For the IMS domain the IRI record types are used in a different way than described in this clause. Details on the IRI type usage in the IMS domain are defined in clause 7.5.\n",
      "The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are defined independently of target communication events. The actual indication of one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI record, is part of further parameters within the record's information content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions are not related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication case, and are therefore independent of future enhancements of the intercepted services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information (i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target communication related information is contained within the information content of the IRI records.\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, if LI is being activated during an already established PDP context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an established PDP context or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can be communicated to the LEA by other means (e.g. HI1).\n",
      "NOTE:\tIn some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc, intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an interception is activated on an already established PDP context or similar.\n",
      "The DF2 shall not send the BEGIN with Start of Interception to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the target communication due to a previous LI activation on the same target.\n",

      "4.6\tReliability\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of the interception of the content of communication should be (at least) equal to the reliability of the original content of communication. For intercepted packet data communications, this may be derived from the QoS class used for the original intercepted session, TSÂ 23.107Â [20].\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of interception of signalling should be (at least) equal to the the reliability of the original signalling.\n",

One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",

      "Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic through MF (as in method B).\n",

Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed.\n",
      "At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> & <leauser> -pair. Once the login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating 'mput' command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. 'pwd') can be sent every T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimised as possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent).\n",

      "B.1\tSyntax definitions\n",
      "The transferred information and messages are encoded to be binary compatible withÂ [5] (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)) andÂ [6] (Basic Encoding Rules (BER)).\n",
      "These recommendations use precise definitions of the words type, class, value, and parameter. Those definitions are paraphrased below for clarity.\n",
      "A type, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a set of all possible values. For example, an INTEGER is a type for all negative and positive integers.\n",
      "A class, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a one of four possible domains for uniquely defining a type. The classes defined by ASN.1 and BER are: UNIVERSAL, APPLICATION, CONTEXT, and PRIVATE.\n",
      "The UNIVERSAL class is reserved for international standards such asÂ [5] andÂ [6]. Users of the protocol may extend the syntax with PRIVATE class parameters without conflict with the present document, but risk conflict with other users' extensions. APPLICATION class parameters are reserved for future extensions.\n",
      "A value is a particular instance of a type. For example, five (5) is a possible value of the type INTEGER.\n",
      "A parameter in the present document is a particular instance of the transfer syntax to transport a value consisting of a tag to identify the parameter type, a length to specify the number of octets in the value, and the value.\n",
      "In the BER a tag (a particular type and class identifier) may either be a primitive or a constructor. A primitive is a pre-defined type (of class UNIVERSAL) and a constructor consists of other types (primitives or other constructors). A constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier alone. Both ends of a communication have to understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT types. EXPLICIT types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER would be tagged only with the Number tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the INTEGER tag within the Number tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT tagging for more compact message encoding.\n",
      "For the coding of the value part of each parameter the general rule is to use a widely use a standardized format when it exists (ISUP, DSS1, MAP, etc.).\n",
      "As a large part of the information exchanged between the user's may be transmitted within ISUP/DSS1 signalling, the using of the coding defined for this signalling guarantee the integrity of the information provided to the LEMF and the evolution of the interface. For example if new values are used within existing ISUP parameters, this new values shall be transmitted transparently toward the LEMF.\n",
      "For the ASN.1 parameters of the type 'OCTET STRING', the ordering of the individual halfoctets of each octet shall be such that the most significant nibble is put into bitposition 5Â -Â 8 and the least significant nibble into bitposition 1Â -Â 4. This general rule shall not apply when parameter formats are imported from other standards, e.g. an E.164 number coded according to ISUP, ITU-TÂ RecommendationÂ Q.763Â [29]. In this case the ordering of the nibbles shall be according to that standard and not be changed.\n",

      "FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the sending node (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries.\n",
      "\n",
      "C.2.2\tUsage of the FTP\n",
      "In the packet data LI the MF acts as the FTP client and the receiving node (LEMF) acts as the FTP server . The client pushes the data to the server.\n",
      "The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The sending entity (MF) may buffer files.\n",
      "Several smaller intercepted data units may be gathered to bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency.\n",
      "The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms.\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.\n",
      "There are two possible ways how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",
      "The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams might also be delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2 and HI3 packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in the IRI and the CC packet streams.\n",
      "File naming:\n",
      "The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference).\n",
      "Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic through a particular MF node (as in method B).\n",
      "The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are \"a\"â€¦\"z\", \"A\"â€¦\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"â€¦\"9\".\n",

The types \"2\", \"4\", and \"6\" are reserved for the HI3 interface and type \"8\" is reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept.\n",

      "Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF\n",
      "This annex is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF.\n",
      "For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a target, it will be necessary for the LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP signaling (as provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media streams. The principal reason for this is that the SDP content within the SIP signaling may provide the information required to even be able to decode the media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP header within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to determine the specific encoding used. The SDP portion of the SIP signaling would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the SIP signaling provides information about the participants in a SIP session (other than the target) sending and receiving the associated media streams. The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of the IMS IRI and all of the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a single LIID is used in association all of the target's IMS identities (as per a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and GSN CC information is fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able to associate each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the CC.\n",
      "The SIP messsages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional items of information that could be relevant with respect to supporting correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and GSN CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is discussed below:\n",
      "-\tCall-ID, From tag, To tag : These SIP headers would identify different SIP messages belonging to the same SIP dialog (a call leg between the target user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is not sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with specific media streams is the principal objective of this discussion.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID): The principal purpose of the IMS Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to correlate charging information provided by different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be useful in correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog identifiers are modified (e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary for the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address): GCIDs, along with the GGSN address, may be used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) are made available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to correlate SIP messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this type of correlation would be useful, although not essential.\n",
      "SDP Connection addresses and ports: The address and port information within the SDP of the SIP messages need to be matched with the addresses and ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC reports. This implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as in the packets provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to simplify the search for a match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may also include essential information about the encoding of each of the media streams, without which it may not be possible to decode.\n",

The MF initiates the establishment of TCP connections to the LEMF equipment designated by the LEA. Optionally, the MF may use more than one TCP connection per LEMF for the purpose of delivering \"LI application\" messages to minimize the effects of congestion or facility failures. For example, if more than one TCP connection was used \"LI application\" messages may be uniformly distributed across the connections. If delays are detected on one TCP connection, the MF could begin to transmit more messages on the other TCP connections.

To accomplish this, ASN.1 modules defined in TSÂ 33.108 define the parameters under different names. In all cases, except the case of VoIP, it is straight forward. The ASN.1 module for HI2 defines the parameter which is imported and used in the ASN.1 module of HI3. In some cases, both HI2 and HI3 modules import the parameter from somewhere else.\n",
