      "Introduction\n",
      "This Technical Specification has been produced by 3GPP TSG SA to allow for the standardization in the area of lawful interception of telecommunications. This document addresses the handover interfaces for lawful interception of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The specification defines the handover interfaces for delivery of lawful interception Intercept Related Information (IRI) and Content of Communication (CC) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility.\n",
      "Laws of individual nations and regional institutions (e.g. European Union), and sometimes licensing and operating conditions define a need to intercept telecommunications traffic and related information in modern telecommunications systems. It has to be noted that lawful interception shall always be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Nothing in this specification, including the definitions, is intended to supplant national law.\n",
      "This specification should be used in conjunction with TS 33.106 [18] and TS 33.107 [19] in the same release. This specification may also be used with earlier releases of TS 33.106 [18] and TS 33.107 [19], as well as for earlier releases of UMTS and GPRS.\n",
      "1\tScope\n",
      "The present document specifies the handover interfaces for Lawful Interception (LI) of Packet-Data Services, Circuit Switched Services, Multimedia Services within the UMTS network and Evolved Packet System (EPS). The handover interface in this context includes the delivery of Intercept Related Information (IRI) through the Handover Interface 2 (HI2) and Content of Communication (CC) through the Handover Interface 3 (HI3) to the Law Enforcement Monitoring Facility (LEMF).\n",

      "identity: technical label which may represent the origin or destination of any telecommunications traffic, as a rule clearly identified by a physical telecommunications identity number (such as a telephone number) or the logical or virtual telecommunications identity number (such as a personal number) which the subscriber can assign to a physical access on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "interception: action (based on the law), performed by a network operator / access provider / service provider, of making available certain information and providing that information to a law enforcement monitoring facility.\n",
      "NOTE 2:\tIn the present document the term interception is not used to describe the action of observing communications by a law enforcement agency.\n",
      "interception configuration information: information related to the configuration of interception.\n",
      "interception interface: physical and logical locations within the network operator's / access provider's / service provider's telecommunications facilities where access to the content of communication and intercept related information is provided. The interception interface is not necessarily a single, fixed point.\n",
      "interception measure: technical measure which facilitates the interception of telecommunications traffic pursuant to the relevant national laws and regulations.\n",
      "intercept related information: collection of information or data associated with telecommunication services involving the target identity, specifically communication associated information or data (e.g. unsuccessful communication attempts), service associated information or data and location information.\n",
      "internal intercepting function: point within a network or network element at which the content of communication and the intercept related information are made available.\n",
      "internal network interface: network's internal interface between the Internal Intercepting Function and a mediation device.\n",
      "invocation and operation: describes the action and conditions under which the service is brought into operation; in the case of a lawful interception this may only be on a particular communication. It should be noted that when lawful interception is activated, it shall be invoked on all communications (Invocation takes place either subsequent to or simultaneously with activation.). Operation is the procedure which occurs once a service has been invoked.\n",
      "NOTE 3:\tThe definition is based on ITU-T Recommendation X.882 [8], but has been adapted for the special application of lawful interception, instead of supplementary services.\n",
      "law enforcement agency: organization authorized by a lawful authorization based on a national law to request interception measures and to receive the results of telecommunications interceptions.\n",

      "precision: the number of digits with which a numerical value is expressed, e.g. the number of decimal digits or bits. Note: precision should not be confused with accuracy, which is a difference between a measured/recorded numerical value and the respective value in the standard reference system.\n",
      "quality of service: quality specification of a telecommunications channel, system, virtual channel, computer-telecommunications session, etc. Quality of service may be measured, for example, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, bit error rate, message throughput rate or call blocking probability.\n",
      "reliability: probability that a system or service will perform in a satisfactory manner for a given period of time when used under specific operating conditions.\n",
      "result of interception: information relating to a target service, including the content of communication and intercept related information, which is passed by a network operator, an access provider or a service provider to a law enforcement agency. Intercept related information shall be provided whether or not call activity is taking place.\n",

      "service provider: natural or legal person providing one or more public telecommunications services whose provision consists wholly or partly in the transmission and routing of signals on a telecommunications network. A service provider needs not necessarily run his own network.\n",
      "SMS: Short Message Service gives the ability to send character messages to phones. SMS messages can be MO (mobile originate) or MT(mobile terminate).\n",
      "target identity: technical identity (e.g. the interception's target directory number), which uniquely identifies a target. One target may have one or several target identities.\n",
      "target service: telecommunications service associated with an target and usually specified in a lawful authorization for interception.\n",
      "NOTE 4:\tThere may be more than one target service associated with a single target.\n",

      "The network requirements mentioned in the present document are derived, in part, from the requirements defined in ETSI ES 201 158 [2].\n",
      "Lawful interception may require functions to be provided in the switching or routing nodes of a telecommunications network.\n",
      "The specification of the handover interface is subdivided into three logical ports each optimised to the different purposes and types of information being exchanged.\n",
      "The interface is extensible. (i.e. the interface may be modified in the future as necessary).\n",
      "4.2\tLegal requirements\n",
      "It shall be possible to select elements from the handover interface specification to conform with:\n",
      "-\tnational requirements;\n",
      "-\tnational law;\n",
      "-\tany law applicable to a specific LEA.\n",
      "As a consequence, the present document shall define, in addition to mandatory requirements, which are always applicable, supplementary options, in order to take into account the various influences listed above. See also ETSI TS 101 331 [1] and ETSI ETR 330 [3].\n",
      "4.3\tFunctional requirements\n",
      "A lawful authorization shall describe the kind of information IRI only, or IRI with CC that is required by an LEA, the identifiers for the target, the start and stop time of LI, and the addresses of the LEAs for delivery of CC and/or IRI and further information.\n",
      "A single target may be the target by different LEAs. It shall be possible strictly to separate these interception measures.\n",
      "If two targets are communicating with each other, each target is dealt with separately.\n",
      "4.4\tOverview of handover interface\n",
      "4.4.0\tIntroduction\n",
      "The generic handover interface adopts a three port structure such that administrative information (HI1), intercept related information (HI2), and the content of communication (HI3) are logically separated.\n",
      "Figure 4.1 shows a block diagram with the relevant entities for Lawful Interception.\n",
      "The outer circle represents the operator's (NO/AN/SP) domain with respect to lawful interception. It contains the network internal functions, the internal network interface (INI), the administration function and the mediation functions for IRI and CC. The inner circle contains the internal functions of the network (e.g. switching, routing, handling of the communication process). Within the network internal function the results of interception (i.e. IRI and CC) are generated in the Internal Interception Function (IIF).\n",
      "The IIF provides the CC and the IRI, respectively, at the Internal Network Interface (INI). For both kinds of information, mediation functions may be used, which provide the final representation of the standardized handover interfaces at the operator's (NO/AN/SP) domain boundary.\n",
      "4.4.1\tHandover interface port 2 (HI2)\n",
      "The handover interface port 2 shall transport the IRI from the operator's (NO/AN/SP) IIF to the LEMF.\n",
      "The delivery of the handover interface port 2 shall be performed via data communication methods which are suitable for the network infrastructure and for the kind and volume of data to be transmitted. From the operator (NO/AN/SP) to LEMF delivery is subject to the facilities that may be procured by the government.\n",
      "The delivery can in principle be made via different types of lower communication layers, which should be standard or widely used data communication protocols.\n",
      "The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic encoding rules (BER). The format of the parameter's information content shall be based on existing telecommunication standards, where possible.\n",
      "The individual IRI parameters have to be sent to the LEMF at least once (if available).\n",
      "The IRI records are transmitted individually. As an option, IRI records can be aggregated for delivery to the same LEA (i.e. in a single delivery interaction). As there are time constraints associated with the delivery of IRI, the use of this optional feature is subject to national or regional requirements. As a general principle, IRI records shall be sent immediately and shall not be withheld in the MF/DF in order to use the IRI record aggregation option.\n",
      "The IRI records shall contain information available from normal provider (NO/AN/SP) operating procedures. In addition the IRI records shall include information for identification and control purposes as specifically required by the HI2 port.\n",
      "The IIF is not required to make any attempt to request explicitly extra information which has not already been supplied by a signalling system.\n",
      "4.4.2\tHandover interface port 3 (HI3)\n",
      "The port HI3 shall transport the CC of the intercepted telecommunication service to the LEMF. The CC shall be presented as a transparent en-clair copy of the information flow during an established, frequently bi-directional, communication of the target. However, in case MIKEY ticket based solution is used for IMS media security as specified in TS 33.328 [54] and CC is presented in encrypted format, the decryption keys and the associated information shall be delivered to the LEMF via appropriate IRI over the HI2.\n",
      "NOTE 1:\tAdditional information needed for decryption, e.g. roll-over counter, will be available as part of intercepted CC.\n",
      "NOTE 2:\tIn this version of the standard, in case of interception starting on ongoing encrypted communication, some information needed for decryption might not be available.\n",
      "NOTE 3:\tIn this version of the standard, immediate rekeying is not supported from the LI perspective.\n",
      "As the appropriate form of HI3 depends upon the service being intercepted, HI3 is described in relevant annexes.\n",
      "The HI2 and HI3 are logically different interfaces, even though in some installations the HI2 and HI3 packet streams might also be delivered via a common transmission path from a MF to a LEMF. It is possible to correlate HI2 and HI3 packet streams by having common (referencing) data fields embedded in the IRI and the CC packet streams.\n",
      "4.5\tHI2: Interface port for intercept related information\n",
      "4.5.0\tGeneral\n",
      "The HI2 interface port shall be used to transport all IRI, i.e. the information or data associated with the communication services of the target identity apparent to the network. It includes signalling information used to establish the telecommunication service and to control its progress, time stamps, and, if available, further information such as location information. Only information which is part of standard network signalling procedures shall be used within communication related IRI.\n",
      "For all UE locations obtained, generated or reported to the LEMF, the MF/DF shall report the time at which the location was established by the location source (e.g. MME or HSS) and provide this to the MF/DF along with the location information. If this information cannot be provided to the MF/DF, then the MF/DF shall indicate that the time is not available. If the information in the MME received over S1 (TS 36.413 [100]) includes one or more cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location reporting is triggered at the MME.\n",
      "Sending of the IRI to the LEMF shall in general take place as soon as possible, after the relevant information is available.\n",
      "In exceptional cases (e.g. data link failure), the IRI may be buffered for later transmission for a specified period of time.\n",
      "Within this clause only, definitions are made which apply in general for all network technologies. Additional technology specific HI2 definitions are specified in related Annexes.\n",
      "4.5.1\tData transmission protocols\n",
      "The protocol used by the \"LI application\" for the encoding and the sending of data between the MF and the LEMF is based on already standardized data transmission protocols.\n",
      "The specified data communication methods provide a general means of data communication between the LEA and the operator's (NO/AN/SP) mediation function. They are used for the delivery of:\n",
      "-\tHI2 type of information (IRI records);\n",
      "-\tCertain types of content of communication (e.g. SMS).\n",
      "The present document specifies the use of the several possible methods for delivery: FTP or TPKT/TCP/IP (specifications for this specific protocol are in Clause G.2 - \"HI2 delivery methods\". This protocol is defined by IETF RFC 2126: \"ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)\" [28] on the application layer and the BER on the presentation layer. The lower layers for data communication may be chosen in agreement with the operator (NO/AN/SP) and the LEA.\n",
      "As an alternative, ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] may be used for the encoding and the sending of data between the MF and the LEMF.\n",
      "The delivery to the LEMF should use the internet protocol stack.\n",
      "NOTE: TPKT/TCP/IP is recommended in the case of IRI only with the option of IRI Packet Header Information reporting.\n",
      "4.5.2\tApplication for IRI (HI2 information)\n",
      "The handover interface port 2 shall transport the IRI from the operator's (NO/AN/SP) MF to the LEMF.\n",
      "The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic encoding rules (BER). Where possible, the format of the information content shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used for these parameters with the network already (e.g. IP). Within the ASN.1 coding for IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet strings.\n",
      "4.5.3\tTypes of IRI records\n",
      "Intercept related information shall be conveyed to the LEMF in messages, or IRI data records, respectively. Four types of IRI records are defined:\n",
      "1)\tIRI-Begin record\tat the first event of a communication attempt,\n",
      "\topening the IRI transaction.\n",
      "2)\tIRI-End record\tat the end of a communication attempt,\n",
      "\tclosing the IRI transaction.\n",
      "3)\tIRI-Continue record\tat any time during a communication attempt\n",
      "\twithin the IRI transaction.\n",
      "4)\tIRI-REPORT record\tused in general for non-communication related events.\n",
      "For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1 to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI transaction for each communication case or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication phase (set-up, active or release).\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, the first event of a communication attempt shall be the PDP context activation or a similar event and an IRI-BEGIN record shall be issued. The end of the communication attempt shall be the PDP context deactivation and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records, IRI-REPORT records otherwise.\n",
      "Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like subscriber controlled input (SCI) for service activation. For simple cases, it can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. It can also be applicable to report some subscriber actions which may trigger communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication, when the communication attempt or the change of the existing communication itself is reported separately.\n",
      "Record type 4 is also used to convey the LALS reports.\n",
      "For the IMS domain the IRI record types are used in a different way than described in this clause. Details on the IRI type usage in the IMS domain are defined in clause 7.5.\n",
      "The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are defined independently of target communication events. The actual indication of one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI record, is part of further parameters within the record's information content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions are not related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication case, and are therefore independent of future enhancements of the intercepted services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information (i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target communication related information is contained within the information content of the IRI records.\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, if LI is being activated during an already established PDP context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an established PDP context or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can be communicated to the LEA by other means (e.g. HI1).\n",
      "NOTE:\tIn some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc, intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an interception is activated on an already established PDP context or similar.\n",
      "The DF2 shall not send the BEGIN with Start of Interception to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the target communication due to a previous LI activation on the same target.\n",
      "4.6\tReliability\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of the interception of the content of communication should be (at least) equal to the reliability of the original content of communication. For intercepted packet data communications, this may be derived from the QoS class used for the original intercepted session, TS 23.107 [20].\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of interception of signalling should be (at least) equal to the the reliability of the original signalling.\n",
      "Reliability from the operator (NO/AN/SP) to the LEMF is determined by what operators (NO/AN/SP) and law enforcement agree upon.\n",
      "5\tCircuit-switch domain\n",
      "5.0\tGeneral\n",
      "For North America, the use of J-STD-025-A [23] is recommended.\n",
      "5.1\tSpecific identifiers for LI\n",
      "5.1.0\tIntroduction\n",
      "Specific identifiers are necessary to identify a target for interception uniquely and to correlate between the data, which is conveyed over the different Handover Interfaces (HI1, HI2 and HI3). The identifiers, which apply to all communication technologies, are defined in the clauses below.\n",
      "5.1.1\tLawful Interception IDentifier (LIID)\n",
      "For each target identity related to an interception measure, the authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall assign a special Lawful Interception IDentifier (LIID), which has been agreed between the LEA and the operator (NO/AN/SP). It is used within parameters of all HI interface ports.\n",
      "Using an indirect identification, pointing to a target identity makes it easier to keep the knowledge about a specific target limited within the authorized operators (NO/AN/SP) and the handling agents at the LEA.\n",
      "The Lawful Interception IDentifier LIID is a component of the CC delivery procedure and of the IRI records. It shall be used within any information exchanged at the Handover Interfaces HI2 and HI3 for identification and correlation purposes.\n",
      "The LIID format shall consist of alphanumeric characters (or digit string for sub-address option, see annex J). It might for example, among other information, contain a lawful authorization reference number, and the date, when the lawful authorization was issued.\n",
      "The authorized operator (NO/AN/SP) shall enter for each target identity of the target a unique LIID.\n",
      "If more than one LEA intercepts the same target identity, there shall be unique LIIDs assigned, relating to each LEA.\n",
      "5.1.2\tCommunication IDentifier (CID)\n",
      "5.1.2.0\tGeneral\n",
      "For each activity relating to a target identity, a CID is generated by the relevant network element. The CID consists of the following two identifiers:\n",
      "-\tNetwork IDentifier (NID);\n",
      "-\tCommunication Identity Number (CIN) - optional.\n",
      "NOTE 1:\tFor all non CC related records like SMS, SCI etc. no correlation to a CC could be made.\n",
      "The CID distinguishes between the different activities of the target identity. It is also used for correlation between IRI records and CC connections, as well as for correlation between LALS reports and IRI records of the triggering events. It is used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3.\n",
      "The Communication IDentifier is specified in the subsequent subclauses of 5.1.2. For ASN.1 coding details, see annex B.\n",
      "5.1.2.1\tNetwork Identifier (NID)\n",

      "-\tOperator - (NO/AN/SP) identifier (mandatory):\n",
      "Unique identification of network operator, access network provider or service provider.\n",
      "-\tNetwork element identifier NEID (optional):\n",
      "The purpose of the network element identifier is to uniquely identify the relevant network element carrying out the LI operations, such as LI activation, IRI record sending, etc.\n",

      "This parameter is mandatory for IRI in case of reporting events for connection-oriented types of communication (e.g. circuit switched calls).\n",
      "The communication identity number is a temporary identifier of an intercepted communication, relating to a specific target identity.\n",
      "The Communication Identity Number (CIN) identifies uniquely an intercepted communications session within the relevant network element. All the results of interception within a single communications session has to have the same CIN. If a single target has two or more communications sessions through the same operator, and through the same network element then the CIN for each session shall be different.\n",
      "NOTE:\tIf two or more target identities, related either to an unique target or to different targets, are involved in the same communication the same CIN value may be assigned by the relevant network element to the communication sessions of the different target identities.\n",
      "5.1.3\tCC link identifier (CCLID)\n",
      "This identifier is only used at the interface ports HI2 and HI3 in case of the reuse of CC links (option B, see clause 5.4.4.2).\n",
      "For each CC link, which is set up by the mediation function towards the LEMF, a CC link identifier (CCLID) is transmitted in the HI2 records and HI3 setup message in addition to CIN and NID. For the correct correlation of multiparty calls this identity number indicates in the IRI records of each multiparty call, which CC link is used for the transmission of the CC.\n",
      "The CCLID may use the same format as the CIN; in this case, it need not be transmitted explicitly during set up of the CC links, as part of HI3. The CIN may also implicitly represent the CCLID.\n",
      "5.1.4\tCorrelation of CC and IRI\n",
      "To assure correlation between the independently transmitted Content of Communication (CC) and Intercept Related Information (IRI) of an intercepted call the following parameters are used:\n",

      "Parameters out of the present document, see clause 5.1.2:\n",
      "Communication Identifier (CID)\n",
      "For each call or other activity relating to a target identity a CID is generated by the relevant network element. The CID consists of the following two identifiers:\n",

      "A.1\tVoid\n",
      "A.2\tFTP\n",
      "A.2.1\tIntroduction\n",
      "At HI2 interface FTP is used over internet protocol stack for the delivery of the IRI. The FTP is defined in IETF STD 9 [13]. The IP is defined in IETF STD0005 [15]. The TCP is defined in IETF STD0007 [16].\n",
      "FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the mediation function (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries.\n",
      "A.2.2\tUsage of the FTP\n",
      "The MF acts as the FTP client and the LEMF acts as the FTP server . The client pushes the data to the server.\n",
      "The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The MF may buffer files.\n",
      "Several records may be gathered into bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency.\n",
      "The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms;\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.\n",
      "Every file shall contain only complete IRI records. The single IRI record shall not be divided into several files.\n",
      "There are two possible ways as to how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",
      "File naming:\n",
      "The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference).\n",
      "Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic through MF (as in method B).\n",
      "The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are \"a\"…\"z\", \"A\"…\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"…\"9\".\n",
      "File naming method A):\n",
      "\t<LIID>_<seq>.<ext>\n",
      "LIID =\tSee clause 7.1.\n",
      "seq =\tinteger ranging between [0..2^64-1], in ASCII form (not exceeding 20 ASCII digits), identifying the sequence number for file transfer from this node per a specific target.\n",
      "ext =\tASCII integer ranging between [\"1\"..\"8\"] (in hex: 31H…38H), identifying the file type. The possible file types are shown in table A.1. Type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and type \"8\" is reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept.\n",
      "A.2.3\tProfiles (informative)\n",
      "As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged by using the FTP, this chapter contains practical considerations how the communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed.\n",
      "At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> & <leauser> -pair. Once the login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating 'mput' command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. 'pwd') can be sent every T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimised as possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent).\n",
      "Simple example of a batch file extract:\n",
      "FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files:\n",
      "To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wild-carded file names, and let the FTP implementation do the file name expansion (instead of shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way:\n",
      "ftp <flags> <destaddr>\n",

      "In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very long period, the local buffering at the MF may have to be terminated. Then the following intercepted data coming from the intercepting nodes to the MF would be discarded, until the transit network or LEMF is up and running again.\n",

      "For the file transfer from the MF to the LEMF(s) e.g. the following data transfer parameters are provided for the FTP client (at the MF):\n",

      "B.1\tSyntax definitions\n",
      "The transferred information and messages are encoded to be binary compatible with [5] (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)) and [6] (Basic Encoding Rules (BER)).\n",
      "These recommendations use precise definitions of the words type, class, value, and parameter. Those definitions are paraphrased below for clarity.\n",
      "A type, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a set of all possible values. For example, an INTEGER is a type for all negative and positive integers.\n",
      "A class, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a one of four possible domains for uniquely defining a type. The classes defined by ASN.1 and BER are: UNIVERSAL, APPLICATION, CONTEXT, and PRIVATE.\n",
      "The UNIVERSAL class is reserved for international standards such as [5] and [6]. Users of the protocol may extend the syntax with PRIVATE class parameters without conflict with the present document, but risk conflict with other users' extensions. APPLICATION class parameters are reserved for future extensions.\n",
      "A value is a particular instance of a type. For example, five (5) is a possible value of the type INTEGER.\n",
      "A parameter in the present document is a particular instance of the transfer syntax to transport a value consisting of a tag to identify the parameter type, a length to specify the number of octets in the value, and the value.\n",
      "In the BER a tag (a particular type and class identifier) may either be a primitive or a constructor. A primitive is a pre-defined type (of class UNIVERSAL) and a constructor consists of other types (primitives or other constructors). A constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier alone. Both ends of a communication have to understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT types. EXPLICIT types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER would be tagged only with the Number tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the INTEGER tag within the Number tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT tagging for more compact message encoding.\n",
      "For the coding of the value part of each parameter the general rule is to use a widely use a standardized format when it exists (ISUP, DSS1, MAP, etc.).\n",
      "As a large part of the information exchanged between the user's may be transmitted within ISUP/DSS1 signalling, the using of the coding defined for this signalling guarantee the integrity of the information provided to the LEMF and the evolution of the interface. For example if new values are used within existing ISUP parameters, this new values shall be transmitted transparently toward the LEMF.\n",
      "For the ASN.1 parameters of the type 'OCTET STRING', the ordering of the individual halfoctets of each octet shall be such that the most significant nibble is put into bitposition 5 - 8 and the least significant nibble into bitposition 1 - 4. This general rule shall not apply when parameter formats are imported from other standards, e.g. an E.164 number coded according to ISUP, ITU-T Recommendation Q.763 [29]. In this case the ordering of the nibbles shall be according to that standard and not be changed.\n",

      "Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF\n",
      "This annex is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF.\n",
      "For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a target, it will be necessary for the LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP signaling (as provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media streams. The principal reason for this is that the SDP content within the SIP signaling may provide the information required to even be able to decode the media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP header within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to determine the specific encoding used. The SDP portion of the SIP signaling would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the SIP signaling provides information about the participants in a SIP session (other than the target) sending and receiving the associated media streams. The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of the IMS IRI and all of the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a single LIID is used in association all of the target's IMS identities (as per a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and GSN CC information is fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able to associate each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the CC.\n",
      "The SIP messsages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional items of information that could be relevant with respect to supporting correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and GSN CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is discussed below:\n",
      "-\tCall-ID, From tag, To tag : These SIP headers would identify different SIP messages belonging to the same SIP dialog (a call leg between the target user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is not sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with specific media streams is the principal objective of this discussion.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID): The principal purpose of the IMS Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to correlate charging information provided by different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be useful in correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog identifiers are modified (e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary for the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address): GCIDs, along with the GGSN address, may be used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) are made available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to correlate SIP messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this type of correlation would be useful, although not essential.\n",
      "SDP Connection addresses and ports: The address and port information within the SDP of the SIP messages need to be matched with the addresses and ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC reports. This implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as in the packets provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to simplify the search for a match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may also include essential information about the encoding of each of the media streams, without which it may not be possible to decode.\n",

      "FigureÂ 4.1 shows a block diagram with the relevant entities for Lawful Interception.\n",
      "The outer circle represents the operator's (NO/AN/SP) domain with respect to lawful interception. It contains the network internal functions, the internal network interface (INI), the administration function and the mediation functions for IRI and CC. The inner circle contains the internal functions of the network (e.g. switching, routing, handling of the communication process). Within the network internal function the results of interception (i.e. IRI and CC) are generated in the Internal Interception Function (IIF).\n",
      "The IIF provides the CC and the IRI, respectively, at the Internal Network Interface (INI). For both kinds of information, mediation functions may be used, which provide the final representation of the standardized handover interfaces at the operator's (NO/AN/SP) domain boundary.\n",

      "The delivery of the handover interface port 2 shall be performed via data communication methods which are suitable for the network infrastructure and for the kind and volume of data to be transmitted. From the operator (NO/AN/SP) to LEMF delivery is subject to the facilities that may be procured by the government.\n",
      "The delivery can in principle be made via different types of lower communication layers, which should be standard or widely used data communication protocols.\n",
      "The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic encoding rules (BER). The format of the parameter's information content shall be based on existing telecommunication standards, where possible.\n",
      "The individual IRI parameters have to be sent to the LEMF at least once (if available).\n",
      "The IRI records are transmitted individually. As an option, IRI records can be aggregated for delivery to the same LEA (i.e. in a single delivery interaction). As there are time constraints associated with the delivery of IRI, the use of this optional feature is subject to national or regional requirements. As a general principle, IRI records shall be sent immediately and shall not be withheld in the MF/DF in order to use the IRI record aggregation option.\n",
      "The IRI records shall contain information available from normal provider (NO/AN/SP) operating procedures. In addition the IRI records shall include information for identification and control purposes as specifically required by the HI2 port.\n",

Only information which is part of standard network signalling procedures shall be used within communication related IRI.\n",
      "For all UE locations obtained, generated or reported to the LEMF, the MF/DF shall report the time at which the location was established by the location source (e.g. MME or HSS) and provide this to the MF/DF along with the location information. If this information cannot be provided to the MF/DF, then the MF/DF shall indicate that the time is not available. If the information in the MME received over S1 (TS 36.413 [100]) includes one or more cell IDs, then all cell IDs shall be reported to the LEMF whenever location reporting is triggered at the MME.\n",
      "Sending of the IRI to the LEMF shall in general take place as soon as possible, after the relevant information is available.\n",
      "In exceptional cases (e.g. data link failure), the IRI may be buffered for later transmission for a specified period of time.\n",

      "The present document specifies the use of the several possible methods for delivery: FTP or TPKT/TCP/IP (specifications for this specific protocol are in Clause G.2 - \"HI2 delivery methods\". This protocol is defined by IETF RFC 2126: \"ISO Transport Service on top of TCP (ITOT)\" [28] on the application layer and the BER on the presentation layer. The lower layers for data communication may be chosen in agreement with the operator (NO/AN/SP) and the LEA.\n",
      "As an alternative, ETSI TS 102 232-1 [104] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [105] may be used for the encoding and the sending of data between the MF and the LEMF.\n",

      "The individual IRI parameters shall be coded using ASN.1 and the basic encoding rules (BER). Where possible, the format of the information content shall be taken over from existing telecommunication standards, which are used for these parameters with the network already (e.g. IP). Within the ASN.1 coding for IRI, such standard parameters are typically defined as octet strings.\n",

      "4.5.3\tTypes of IRI records\n",
      "Intercept related information shall be conveyed to the LEMF in messages, or IRI data records, respectively. Four types of IRI records are defined:\n",

      "3)\tIRI-Continue record\tat any time during a communication attempt\n",
      "\twithin the IRI transaction.\n",
      "4)\tIRI-REPORT record\tused in general for non-communication related events.\n",
      "For information related to an existing communication case, the record types 1 to 3 shall be used. They form an IRI transaction for each communication case or communication attempt, which corresponds directly to the communication phase (set-up, active or release).\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, the first event of a communication attempt shall be the PDP context activation or a similar event and an IRI-BEGIN record shall be issued. The end of the communication attempt shall be the PDP context deactivation and an IRI-END record shall be issued. While a PDP context is active, IRI-CONTINUE records shall be used for CC relevant IRI data records, IRI-REPORT records otherwise.\n",
      "Record type 4 is used for non-communication related subscriber action, like subscriber controlled input (SCI) for service activation. For simple cases, it can also be applicable for reporting unsuccessful communication attempts. It can also be applicable to report some subscriber actions which may trigger communication attempts or modifications of an existing communication, when the communication attempt or the change of the existing communication itself is reported separately.\n",
      "Record type 4 is also used to convey the LALS reports.\n",
      "For the IMS domain the IRI record types are used in a different way than described in this clause. Details on the IRI type usage in the IMS domain are defined in clause 7.5.\n",
      "The record type is an explicit part of the record. The 4 record types are defined independently of target communication events. The actual indication of one or several communication events, which caused the generation of an IRI record, is part of further parameters within the record's information content. Consequently, the record types of the IRI transactions are not related to specific messages of the signalling protocols of a communication case, and are therefore independent of future enhancements of the intercepted services, of network specific features, etc. Any transport level information (i.e. higher-level services) on the target communication-state or other target communication related information is contained within the information content of the IRI records.\n",
      "For packet oriented data services, if LI is being activated during an already established PDP context or similar, an IRI-BEGIN record will mark the start of the interception. If LI is being deactivated during an established PDP context or similar, no IRI-END record will be transmitted. The end of interception can be communicated to the LEA by other means (e.g. HI1).\n",
      "NOTE:\tIn some situation (e.g. during activation of second, third, etc, intercepts on the target), the MF/DF may have to detect on its own that an interception is activated on an already established PDP context or similar.\n",
      "The DF2 shall not send the BEGIN with Start of Interception to the LEMFs that were already intercepting the target communication due to a previous LI activation on the same target.\n",

      "4.6\tReliability\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of the interception of the content of communication should be (at least) equal to the reliability of the original content of communication. For intercepted packet data communications, this may be derived from the QoS class used for the original intercepted session, TSÂ 23.107Â [20].\n",
      "The reliability associated with the result of interception of signalling should be (at least) equal to the the reliability of the original signalling.\n",

      "Clause 7 deals with IRI reporting in the IMS. IRI reporting in the multi-media domain specified in this clause does not depend on the IP-Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN), defined in TSÂ 23.228Â [40], used to transport the CC. When the IP-CAN is the UMTS PS domain, annexes C and G apply for CC interception at the SGSN/GGSN. However, such CC interception may intercept more than just the CC associated with an IMS based voice service. Hence, for separated VoIP CC intercept and reporting, refer to clause 12.\n",
      "In addition, this clause also specifies IRI reporting from the HSS handling subscriber data for IMS network. Target identities to be used for interception of IRIs at the HSS are specified in TS 33.107 [19].\n",
      "According to TSÂ 33.107Â [19], interception in the CSCFs shall be supported in the S-CSCF and optionally in the P-CSCF where the S-CSCF and the P-CSCF are in the same network. For roaming scenarios where the P-CSCF is in the Visited Network, interception at the P-CSCF is mandatory. The target identities for the intercept of traffic at the CSCFs are only the SIP-URI, TEL-URI and IMEI (described in TSÂ 23.003Â [25], obtained from the Instance IDs, described also in TSÂ 23.003Â [25] as requested in clause7A.8 of TSÂ 33.107Â [19]. In the intercepting nodes (CSCF's) the relevant SIP-Messages are duplicated and forwarded to the MF HI2.\n",
      "The enhanced P-CSCF (eP-CSCF) shall adhere to all the LI requirements pertaining to a P-CSCF. Any additional LI requirements pertaining to the support of Web Real Time Communications (WebRTC) Interworking as specified in TSÂ 23.228Â [40] that only apply to the eP-CSCF are described distinctly.\n",
      "In case of target manipulation of IMS supplementary service setting, the interception shall be made by XCAP servers maintaining XCAP resources related to the supplementary service settings defined in TSÂ 22.173Â [78] made on the interface Ut as described in TSÂ 24.623Â [77]. Any other points related to attempts to access to Target's XCAP servers or, XCAP change/transaction in services setting related to the target, are for further studies.\n",
      "Ut based XCAP manipulation messages for the IMS services for the target is reported. Any copy \"en clair\" of the XCAP exchanges (aggregated or not), between the UE and the AS, will be transmitted to the LEMF in the HI2 interface through the DF 2, that will encapsulate the XCAP Ut transactions in ASN.1. Such XCAP transactions on the Ut interface have to include any exchange of data, which are contained in the XCAP payload (e.g. the get, put, and delete operations on the XCAP resources).\n",
      "NOTE:\tInterception of the target's supplementary service setting management or modifications that are made outside the Ut interface is for further studies.\n",
      "For clarification, see FigureÂ 7.1. If the P-CSCF and S-CSCF are in the same network and LI is provided at both P-CSCF and S-CSCF, the events are sent twice to the LEMF.\n",

      "For the delivery of CC and IRI the SGSN, GGSN and CSCF's provide correlation numbers and target identities to the HI2 and HI3. The correlation number provided in the PS domain (SGSN, GGSN) is unique per PDP context and is used to correlate CC with IRI and the different IRI's of one PDP context. However, where separated delivery of IMS based VoIP is required, to ensure that the CC related to an IMS based VoIP call is intercepted and reported separately from other PS domain services while being correlated to the IMS based VoIP IRI, refer to clause 12.\n",
      "Interception is performed on an IMS identifier(s) associated with the target including identifiers such as IMEI, SIP-URI and Tel-URI, ETSIÂ ENÂ 300Â 356Â [30].\n",
      "In addition, in case of interception at the HSS, IMSI shall be supported as target identity if it is available in the subscription data stored in the HSS and the association with IMS identities can be done.\n",
      "IMEI and MSISDN shall be supported as target identities if the HSS is shared with access services (e.g. PS, EPS) and the association with IMS identities can be done.\n",
      "Non-Local ID interception is based on SIP-URI or Tel URI. Non-Local Id may be present in any of the SIP headers used to identify either the calling party information and redirecting party information present in the incoming SIP message for incoming calls from target Non-Local ID, or the called party information present in the outgoing SIP message for outgoing calls to target Non-Local ID.\n",

      "Note that, in order to simplify the use of the LIID at the LEMF for the purpose of correlating IMS signalling with GSN CC, the use of a single LIID in association with potentially numerous IMS identities (IMEI, SIP and TEL URIs) is recommended.\n",

The Correlation Number was initially defined to carry a GPRS/EPS Correlation Number and is limited to those access types that support a PDP Context/EPS Bearer. Subsequently, the Correlation parameter was defined to enable a more general correlation. The value used in the Correlation number parameter or the Correlation parameter may be generated by the CSCF.\n",
      "When clause 12 is used to provide separated IMS VoIP intercept and delivery, imsVoIP (as defined in clause 12) may be used to provide the correlation between the IRI and CC of an IMS VoIP session and also between IRI messages of the same IMS VoIP session.\n",

      "For a GPRS/UMTS access or LTE access, if two PDP contexts or two EPS Bearers are used for the communication (one for signalling and one for bearer) two correlation numbers may be delivered via the CSCFs.

      "NOTE 3:\tThe LIID may be used to associate SIP messages with respective GSN IRI records. In case the target is only permitted to have a single SIP session with a single CC bearer active at any time, the LIID is sufficient to correlate IMS IRI records with GSN IRI records. In all other case s, e.g. the target is permitted to have multiple SIP sessions active concurrently, a combination of the LIID and an implementation dependent number may be used to correlate the IMS IRI records with the GSN IRI records.\n",

      "A.2.1\tIntroduction\n",
      "At HI2 interface FTP is used over internet protocol stack for the delivery of the IRI. The FTP is defined in IETFÂ STDÂ 9Â [13]. The IP is defined in IETFÂ STD0005Â [15]. The TCP is defined in IETFÂ STD0007Â [16].\n",
      "FTP supports reliable delivery of data. The data may be temporarily buffered in the mediation function (MF) in case of link failure. FTP is independent of the payload data it carries.\n",
      "A.2.2\tUsage of the FTP\n",
      "The MF acts as the FTP client and the LEMF acts as the FTP server . The client pushes the data to the server.\n",
      "The receiving node LEMF stores the received data as files. The MF may buffer files.\n",
      "Several records may be gathered into bigger packages prior to sending, to increase bandwidth efficiency.\n",
      "The following configurable intercept data collection (= transfer package closing / file change) threshold parameters should be supported:\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on send timeout, e.g. X ms;\n",
      "-\tfrequency of transfer, based on volume trigger, e.g. X octets.\n",
      "Every file shall contain only complete IRI records. The single IRI record shall not be divided into several files.\n",
      "There are two possible ways as to how the interception data may be sent from the MF to the LEMF. One way is to produce files that contain interception data only for one observed target (see: \"File naming method A)\"). The other way is to multiplex all the intercepted data that MF receives to the same sequence of general purpose interception files sent by the MF (see: \"File naming method B)\").\n",
      "File naming:\n",
      "The names for the files transferred to a LEA are formed according to one of the 2 available formats, depending on the delivery file strategy chosen (e.g. due to national convention or operator preference).\n",
      "Either each file contains data of only one observed target (as in method A) or several targets' data is put to files common to all observed target traffic through MF (as in method B).\n",
      "The maximum set of allowed characters in interception file names are \"a\"â€¦\"z\", \"A\"â€¦\"Z\", \"-\", \"_\", \".\", and decimals \"0\"â€¦\"9\".\n",

      "\t<LIID>_<seq>.<ext>\n",
      "LIID =\tSee clause 7.1.\n",
      "seq =\tinteger ranging between [0..2^64-1], in ASCII form (not exceeding 20 ASCII digits), identifying the sequence number for file transfer from this node per a specific target.\n",
      "ext =\tASCII integer ranging between [\"1\"..\"8\"] (in hex: 31Hâ€¦38H), identifying the file type. The possible file types are shown in table A.1. Type \"1\" is reserved for IRI data files and type \"8\" is reserved for data files according to a national requirement by using the same file naming concept.\n",
      "A.2.3\tProfiles (informative)\n",
      "As there are several ways (usage profiles) how data transfer can be arranged by using the FTP, this chapter contains practical considerations how the communications can be set up. Guidance is given for client-server arrangements, session establishments, time outs, the handling of the files (in RAM or disk). Example batch file is described for the case that the sending FTP client uses files. If instead (logical) files are sent directly from the client's RAM memory, then the procedure can be in principle similar though no script file would then be needed.\n",
      "At the LEMF side, FTP server process is run, and at MF, FTP client. No FTP server (which could be accessed from outside the operator network) shall run in the MF. The FTP client can be implemented in many ways, and here the FTP usage is presented with an example only. The FTP client can be implemented by a batch file or a file sender program that uses FTP via an API. The login needs to occur only once per e.g. <destaddr> & <leauser> -pair. Once the login is done, the files can then be transferred just by repeating 'mput' command and checking the transfer status (e.g. from the API routine return value). To prevent inactivity timer triggering, a dummy command (e.g. 'pwd') can be sent every T seconds (T should be less than L, the actual idle time limit). If the number of FTP connections is wanted to be as minimised as possible, the FTP file transfer method \"B\" is to be preferred to the method A (though the method A helps more the LEMF by pre-sorting the data sent).\n",
      "Simple example of a batch file extract:\n",
      "FTP commands usage scenario for transferring a list of files:\n",
      "To prevent FTP cmd line buffer overflow the best way is to use wild-carded file names, and let the FTP implementation do the file name expansion (instead of shell). The number of files for one mput is not limited this way:\n",

      "In case the transit network or receiving end system (LEMF) is down for a very long period, the local buffering at the MF may have to be terminated.

      "The transferred information and messages are encoded to be binary compatible withÂ [5] (Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)) andÂ [6] (Basic Encoding Rules (BER)).\n",
      "These recommendations use precise definitions of the words type, class, value, and parameter. Those definitions are paraphrased below for clarity.\n",
      "A type, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a set of all possible values. For example, an INTEGER is a type for all negative and positive integers.\n",
      "A class, in the context of the abstract syntax or transfer syntax, is a one of four possible domains for uniquely defining a type. The classes defined by ASN.1 and BER are: UNIVERSAL, APPLICATION, CONTEXT, and PRIVATE.\n",
      "The UNIVERSAL class is reserved for international standards such asÂ [5] andÂ [6]. Users of the protocol may extend the syntax with PRIVATE class parameters without conflict with the present document, but risk conflict with other users' extensions. APPLICATION class parameters are reserved for future extensions.\n",
      "A value is a particular instance of a type. For example, five (5) is a possible value of the type INTEGER.\n",
      "A parameter in the present document is a particular instance of the transfer syntax to transport a value consisting of a tag to identify the parameter type, a length to specify the number of octets in the value, and the value.\n",
      "In the BER a tag (a particular type and class identifier) may either be a primitive or a constructor. A primitive is a pre-defined type (of class UNIVERSAL) and a constructor consists of other types (primitives or other constructors). A constructor type may either be IMPLICIT or EXPLICIT. An IMPLICIT type is encoded with the constructor identifier alone. Both ends of a communication have to understand the underlying structure of the IMPLICIT types. EXPLICIT types are encoded with the identifiers of all the contained types. For example, an IMPLICIT Number of type INTEGER would be tagged only with the Number tag, where an EXPLICIT number of type INTEGER would have the INTEGER tag within the Number tag. The present document uses IMPLICIT tagging for more compact message encoding.\n",

      "Correlation indications of IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF\n",
      "This annex is informative and provides some guidelines pertaining to correlating IMS IRI with GSN CC at the LEMF.\n",
      "For IMS-enabled multimedia communication scenarios involving a target, it will be necessary for the LEMF to be able to correlate the media streams (as provided in the CC intercepted by the GSN) with the specific SIP signaling (as provided in the IRI intercepted by the CSCFs) used to establish those media streams. The principal reason for this is that the SDP content within the SIP signaling may provide the information required to even be able to decode the media streams. In certain cases, for example, the information in the RTP header within the media stream packets may not be sufficient to be able to determine the specific encoding used. The SDP portion of the SIP signaling would need to provide this information. Another important reason is that the SIP signaling provides information about the participants in a SIP session (other than the target) sending and receiving the associated media streams. The LIID parameter in the IMS IRI and GSN CC can be used to correlating all of the IMS IRI and all of the GSN CC associated with a particular target. If a single LIID is used in association all of the target's IMS identities (as per a NO/AN/SP agreement with the LEA), the process of associating the IMS IRI and GSN CC information is fairly straightforward. If, however, multiple LIIDs are used (e.g. one per IMS identity) then the LEMF needs to be able to associate each of the LIIDs that may be used for the IMS IRI with the LIID used for the CC.\n",
      "The SIP messsages provided to the LEMF would contain a number of additional items of information that could be relevant with respect to supporting correlations of various types. Their potential role in correlating IMS IRI and GSN CC (or, more specifically, correlating SIP dialogs with media streams) is discussed below:\n",
      "-\tCall-ID, From tag, To tag : These SIP headers would identify different SIP messages belonging to the same SIP dialog (a call leg between the target user and a peer SIP user). It should be noted that the Call-ID alone is not sufficient to identify a dialog. Correlating specific SIP dialogs with specific media streams is the principal objective of this discussion.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (IMS Charging ID): The principal purpose of the IMS Charging ID (ICID) in IMS is to correlate charging information provided by different network entities for the same call. The ICID could be useful in correlating SIP messages belonging to the same call, even if their SIP dialog identifiers are modified (e.g. by a B2BUA application server). It should be noted, however, that the use of the ICID is not necessary for the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs and the corresponding media streams.\n",
      "-\tP-Charging-Vector (GPRS Charging ID, GGSN address): GCIDs, along with the GGSN address, may be used as identifiers of the PDP contexts. These identifiers (one for each PDP context used by the SIP session) are made available to the P-CSCF and subsequently to the S-CSCF. They could be used to correlate SIP messages with the PDP context(s) used. For the purpose of correlating SIP dialogs with media streams, this type of correlation would be useful, although not essential.\n",
      "SDP Connection addresses and ports: The address and port information within the SDP of the SIP messages need to be matched with the addresses and ports corresponding to the media streams as provided in the CC reports. This implies a need to look both at the SDP content of the SIP messages as well as in the packets provided by the GSN. The set of PDP context identifiers included in the P-Charging-Vector could be used to simplify the search for a match. It should also be noted that the SDP contained in the SIP message may also include essential information about the encoding of each of the media streams, without which it may not be possible to decode.\n",

A TCP/IP connection shall be capable of transporting \"LI application\" messages for multiple surveillance cases to a single LEA. The MF initiates the establishment of TCP connections to the LEMF equipment designated by the LEA. Optionally, the MF may use more than one TCP connection per LEMF for the purpose of delivering \"LI application\" messages to minimize the effects of congestion or facility failures. For example, if more than one TCP connection was used \"LI application\" messages may be uniformly distributed across the connections. If delays are detected on one TCP connection, the MF could begin to transmit more messages on the other TCP connections.
