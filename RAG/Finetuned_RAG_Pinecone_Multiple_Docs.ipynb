This implies that, before any testing is performed, the hardware and software has been installed correctly, the network product is powered on, and communication has been established over all standardized interfaces and OAM interfaces related with the network product\\'s functionality, as described in the vendor\\'s documentation. \\nCommunication over external non standardized Interfaces that may exist and are marked as optional, according to the vendor\\'s documentation, shall also be established during testing unless they are explicitly marked as \"not recommended\" in the vendor\\'s documentation. \\nFor each of the enabled external communication interfaces there may be various optional capabilities. During testing, all such capabilities shall be enabled unless they are explicitly marked as \"not recommended\" in the vendor\\'s documentation.\\nIn some cases a testcase might require configuration changes as part of the execution steps or pre-conditions. After such test is executed and prior to any further test execution it needs to be ensured that the state of the ToE is restored back in the original state.\\nSCAS testing is not about security in operations and deployments. So, in particular, SCAS testing is independent of any operator guidelines or considerations on specific deployment scenarios.4.1.2\\tUse of tools in testing \\t\\nThe following text shall apply to all test cases described in the present document: \\nThe present document takes into account that the landscape of testing tools evolves more rapidly than SCAS specifications. It is therefore allowed that, for each requirement, the actual test carried out may deviate from the stepwise description of the test case in the present document if the following conditions are fulfilled: \\n(1)\\t The test is carried out by preferably using Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) and Free-Open-Source-Software (FOSS) tools that are available for other testers that may want to repeat the test. In case a tool not in any of these two categories is used then evidence of the quality assurance of the tool needs to be provided. This applies only to tools used to perform the actual test and not supportive tools needed for setting up the testing environment like for example traffic generators/ simulators.\\nIn cases where a test lab is not able to obtain the necessary tools to perform the test, vendor proprietary test tools may be used by the test lab as long the test tool is controlled under a suitable quality management system (QMS). The test lab ensures that this QMS is in place in order to avail of a vendor’s test tool.\\nAdditionally in cases where the accredited test lab does not have the necessary test environment to perform a test, it shall be possible for the accredited test lab personnel to perform the test in a vendor\\'s test lab. In such cases the accredited lab should record details of test environment, test set-up used and how the test was performed.\\n(2)\\t The tester provides evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of the tool, that the tool is suitable to verify the requirement, and the scope of testing is equal or larger to the one of the test case described in the present document. The evidence needs to be sufficiently detailed for experts in the field of testing, not for the general public. \\n(3)\\t The tester provides evidence that the tool has been actually used for testing the network product (e.g. by providing a trace).4.1.3\\tDocumentation Requirements\\t\\nWhen a test case makes an assumption on the availability of certain items in the product documentation then this assumption is to be considered part of the requirement even if the requirements text does not mention the documentation.4.2\\tSecurity functional requirements and related test cases4.2.1\\tIntroduction\\nThe present clause describes the security functional requirements and the corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product class. In particular the proposed security requirements are classified in two groups: \\n-\\tSecurity functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and detailed in clause 4.2.2\\n-\\tGeneral security functional requirements which include requirements not already addressed in the 3GPP specifications but whose support is also important to ensure a network product conforms to a common security baseline detailed in clause 4.2.3.4.2.2\\tSecurity functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and related test cases\\n4.2.2.1\\tSecurity functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications – general approach\\nThe present clause describes the general approach taken towards security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and the corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product class. \\nIt is assumed for the purpose of the present SCAS that a network product conforms to all mandatory security-related provisions in 3GPP specifications pertaining to it, in particular: \\n-\\tall 3GPP specifications of the 33-series (security specifications) that are pertinent to the network product class;\\n-\\tother 3GPP specifications that make reference to security specifications or are referred to from one of them. \\n3GPP has decided to develop test specifications for the UE in the TSs of the 34-series under the responsibility of Working Group RAN5. 3GPP saw, however, no need to develop test specifications for network elements. For network elements, 3GPP rather trusts that tests are run under the responsibility of the vendors.\\nSecurity procedures pertaining to a network product are typically embedded in non-security procedures and are hence assumed to be tested together with them. \\nIt is the purpose of the present SCAS to identify security requirements from the EPS and 5G security architecture that require special attention in testing as they may:\\n(a) lead to vulnerabilities when not satisfied;\\n(b) not be captured through ordinary testing activity for non-security procedures;\\n(c) address security-relevant failure cases and exceptions or \\'negative\\' requirements of the kind: \"The network product shall not…\"\\nIt is not an intention of the present document to provide an exhaustive set of test cases that would be sufficient to demonstrate conformance of all security procedures with the above-mentioned specifications.\\n4.2.2.2\\tSecurity functional requirements derived from 3GPP specifications – general SBA/SBI aspects\\n4.2.2.2.1\\tIntroduction\\nThe purpose of the sub-clauses in 4.2.2.2 is to identify and describe the general baseline requirements from SBA security architecture and the corresponding test cases.

Further measures (that are beyond the scope of the present document) may be required by local regulation depending on the classification of the data and other factors such as type of network used during transmission, storage location for data, etc.\\n4.2.3.2.2\\tProtecting data and information – Confidential System Internal Data\\nRequirement Name: Unauthorized Viewing\\nRequirement Description: When the system is not under maintenance, there shall be no system function that reveals confidential system internal data in the clear to users and administrators. Such functions could be, for example, local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages, alarms, configuration file exports etc. Confidential system internal data contains authentication data (i.e. PINs, cryptographic keys, passwords, cookies) as well as system internal data that is not required for systems administration and could be of advantage to attackers (i.e. stack traces in error messages).\\nSecurity Objective references: tba.\\nTest case: \\nTest Name: TC_CONFIDENTIAL_SYSTEM_INTERNAL_DATA\\nPurpose:\\nVerify that no system function reveals sensitive data in the clear \\nProcedure and execution steps:\\nPre-Condition:\\nThe vendor shall provide documentation describing how confidential system internal information that could possibly be revealed in clear-text is handled by system functions.\\nA list of all system functions in the network product, information on how to enable and execute them should be provided as a part of the vendor\\'s documentation. A system function is every function implemented in the network product needed by the services/functionalities provided by the network product itself.\\nExecution Steps\\nExecute the following steps:\\n1.\\tReview the documentation provided by the vendor describing how confidential system internal information is handled by system functions.\\n2.\\tThe tester checks whether any system functions as described in the product documentation (e.g. local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages, alarms, error messages, configuration file exports, stack traces)  reveal any confidential system internal data in the clear (for example, passphrases). \\nExpected Results:\\nThere should be no confidential system internal data revealed in the clear by any\\t system function.\\nExpected format of evidence:\\nEvidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the operational results.\\n4.2.3.2.3\\tProtecting data and information in storage\\nRequirement Name: Protecting data and information in storage\\nRequirement Description:\\nFor sensitive data in (persistent or temporary) storage read access rights shall be restricted. Files of a system that are needed for the functionality shall be protected against manipulation.\\nIn addition, the following rules apply for: \\n-\\tSystems that need access to identification and authentication data in the clear, e.g. in order to perform an authentication. Such systems shall not store this data in the clear, but scramble or encrypt it by implementation-specific means.\\n-\\tSystems that do not need access to sensitive data (e.g. user passwords) in the clear. Such systems shall hash this sensitive data with a non-broken cryptographic hash algorithm and use mechanisms to make dictionary attacks more difficult and prevent hash collisions when using identical sensitive data. A common mechanism is e.g., using a unique, random salt per record. \\nNOTE 1:\\tA \"non-broken\" cryptographic hash algorithm is a cryptographic hash algorithm without publicly available/published vulnerabilities.\\n-\\tStored files on the network product: examples for protection against manipulation are the use of checksum or cryptographic methods.\\nSecurity Objective references: tba\\nTest case: \\nTest Name: TC_PSW_STOR_SUPPORT\\nPurpose:\\nVerify that Password storage uses a non-broken one-way cryptographic hash algorithm.\\nProcedure and execution steps:\\nPre-Conditions:\\n-\\tThe tester can access the storage of own user account password. \\n-\\tThe tester has privileges to change the password.\\n-\\tThe original password is P1.\\n-\\tNew passwords are represented by the variable P2.\\nExecution Steps\\n1.\\tThe tester accesses the storage where the result of P1 is, and the corresponding hash value is recorded as A\\n2.\\tThe tester changes the password with P2, then the tester records the storage hash value of the new password as B\\n3.\\tThe tester repeats the step 2 to get other records with the following requirements for password P2:\\n-\\tat least one new password P2 differs from P1 by exactly one bit\\n-\\tat least one new password P2 shall be the same as P1\\n-\\tat least one new password P2 shall have a different length compared to P1\\n4. The tester verifies whether all the records comply with the characteristic of one-way cryptographic hash result.\\na. All collected records contain different hash values, even if the corresponding passwords were identical.\\nNOTE 2: \\tEven if P1 and P2 only differ by one bit, the resulting hash values should differ substantially. (Bit independence criterion) \\nb. The bit length of the hash values is fixed and independent from the password length.\\nc. The hash value does not contain any information that could be used for password disclosure. (e.g. contains part of the password in plain text or some sort of password length indicator)\\nNOTE 3: \\tDepending on the implementation the recorded hash values A and B could be stored with their salt combined in some way (e.g. salt is prefix or suffix of hash value).

If a tool is used then the tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to the steps described below.\\nTest Case: \\nTest Name: TC_BVT_PORT_SCANNING\\nPurpose:\\nTo ensured that on all network interfaces, only documented ports on the transport layer respond to requests from outside the system\\nProcedure and execution steps:\\nPre-Conditions:\\nA list of all available network services containing at least the following information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network Product:\\n1.\\tall interfaces providing IP-based protocols;\\n2.\\tthe available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;\\n3.\\ttheir open ports and associated services per transport layer protocol;\\n4.\\tand a free-form description of their purposes.\\nThe port scanning tool that is used shall be capable to detect open ports on the relevant transport layer protocols.\\nNOTE: \\tIt might not be possible for certain transport layer protocols (like UDP) to unambiguously detect whether a port is open or not by means of external port scanning. Also in some circumstances it might not be efficient to do external port scanning, e.g. if there are security measures to limit the rate a system can be probed. In those cases the accredited evaluator\\'s test laboratory determines another means suitable to verify which ports are open.\\nExecution Steps\\nThe accredited evaluator\\'s test lab is required to execute the following steps:\\n1.\\tVerification of the compliance to the prerequisites:\\na.\\tVerification that the list of available network services is available in the documentation of the Network Product \\nb.\\tValidation that all entries in the list of services are meaningful and reasonably necessary for the operation of the Network Product class\\n2.\\tIdentification of the open ports by means of capable port scanning tools or other suitable testing means\\n3.\\tVerification that the list of identified open ports matches the list of available network services in the documentation of the Network Product \\nExpected Results:\\nThe used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), used settings, and the relevant output containing all the technically relevant information about test results is evidence and shall be part of the testing documentation.\\nAll discrepancies between the list of identified open ports and the list of available network services in the documentation shall be highlighted in the testing documentation.\\nExpected format of evidence:\\n Output of portscan and list of identified discrepancies.4.4.3\\tVulnerability scanning\\nRequirement Name: Vulnerability scanning\\nRequirement Description: \\nThe purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there are no known vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified and remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product, both in the OS and in the applications installed, that can be detected by means of automatic testing tools via the Internet Protocol enabled network interfaces.\\nVulnerability scanning tools may also report false positives and they shall be investigated and documented in the test report.\\nThe test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool or manually performed as described below. If a tool is used then the tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to the steps described below.\\nTest case: \\nTest Name: TC_BVT_VULNERABILITY_SCANNING\\nPurpose:\\nThe purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there are no known vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified and remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product that can be detected by means of automatic testing tools via the Internet Protocol enabled network interfaces.\\nProcedure and execution steps:\\nPre-Conditions:\\nA list of all available network services containing at least the following information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network Product:\\n-\\tall interfaces providing IP-based protocols;\\n-\\tthe available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;\\n-\\ttheir open ports and associated services;\\n-\\tand a free-form description of their purposes.\\nNOTE 1: \\tThis list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning activity.\\n\\nThe used vulnerability scanning tool shall be capable to detect known vulnerabilities on common services. The used vulnerability information shall be reasonably recent at the time of testing.\\nExecution Steps\\nThe accredited evaluator\\'s test lab is required to execute the following steps:\\n1.\\tExecution of the suitable vulnerability scanning tool against all interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product.\\n2.\\tEvaluation of the results based on their severity.\\nExpected Results:\\nThe used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and shall be part of the testing documentation.\\nThe discovered vulnerabilities (including source, example CVE ID), together with a rating of their severity, shall be highlighted in the testing documentation.\\nCOTS Vulnerability scanners, by their nature, (e.g. depending on how they are configured) may result in false findings/positives. The tool’s documentation may even mention that the failing test shall be repeated to check whether it is really a recurring problem or not. The tester shall make best effort to determine if there is an issue with NE or the test tool and if necessary, work with the vendor of the network product to come to a consensus on the test result outcome.\\nNOTE 2: \\tThis testing documentation is input to the vulnerability mitigation process (that may include patching). This is part of the product lifecycle management process developed by GSMA SECAG.\\nExpected format of evidence:\\nOutput of BVT tool.4.4.4\\tRobustness and fuzz testing \\nRequirement Name: Robustness and fuzz testing\\nRequirement Reference: 4.2.6.2.2. – Interface Robustness requirements\\nRequirement Description:\\n It shall be ensured that externally reachable services are reasonably robust when receiving unexpected input\\nTest case: \\nTest Name: TC_BVT_ROBUSTNESS AND FUZZ TESTING\\nPurpose:\\nTo verify that the network product provides externally reachable services which are robust against unexpected input. The target of this test are the protocol stacks (e.g. diameter stack) rather than the applications (e.g. web app).\\nProcedure and execution steps:\\nPre-Conditions:\\n-\\tThe tester has the privileges to log in the network product and to access all system resources (e.g. log files)\\n-\\tA list of all available network services containing at least the following information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network Product:\\n-\\tall interfaces providing IP-based protocols;\\n-\\tthe available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;\\n-\\ttheir open ports and associated services;\\n-\\tand a free-form description of their purposes.\\nNOTE: \\tThis list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning activity.\\n-\\tThe robustness and fuzzing tools that are selected for this test shall utilize state-of-the-art technology to identify input which causes the Network Product to behave in an unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected manner.\\n-\\tFuzz testing tools are a highly sophisticated technology and adaptation to the individual protocols in question is needed to be effective. Therefore, there is a lack of available effective fuzz testing tools available especially for protocols proprietary to the Telco industry. Taking into account note 4 of TR 33.916\\'s clause 7.2.4, test labs shall acquire fuzz testing tools for those protocols where commercially feasible.\\n-\\tIt needs to be taken into account that fuzz testing tools might show drastic differences in terms of effectiveness. The accredited test lab is expected to have sufficient expertise to recognize the level of effectiveness of the available tools.\\n-\\tA network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product and on a tester machine is available.\\nExecution Steps\\nThe accredited evaluator\\'s test lab is required to execute the following steps:\\n1.\\tExecution of available effective fuzzing tools against the protocols available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product for an amount of time sufficient to be effective.\\n2.\\tExecution of available effective robustness test tools against the protocols available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product for an amount of time sufficient to be effective.\\n3.\\tFor both step 1 and 2:\\na.\\tUsing a network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product, the tester verifies that the packets are correctly processed by the network product. \\nb.\\tThe testers verifies that the network product and any running network service does not crash. \\nc.\\tThe execution of tests shall run sufficient times. \\nExpected Results:\\nA list of all of the protocols of the network product reachable externally on an IP-based interface, together with an indication whether effective available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them, shall be part of the testing documentation. If no tool can be acquired for a protocol, a free form statement should explain why not.\\nThe used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and shall be part of the testing documentation.\\nAny input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour, and a description of this behaviour shall be highlighted in the testing documentation.\\nCOTS fuzzing tools, by their nature, may have an acceptable failure rate (e.g. 0.1%) due to different non-deterministic variables in their implementation. At some point the tool’s documentation may even mention that the failing test shall be repeated to check whether it is really a recurring problem or not. The tester shall make best effort to determine if there is an issue with NE or the test tool and if necessary, work with the vendor of the network product to come to a consensus on the test result outcome.\\nExpected format of evidence:\\nA testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of the following information:\\n-\\tThe used tool(s) name and version information,\\n-\\tSettings and configurations used\\n-    The output log file of the chosen tool that displays the results (passed/failed).\\n-\\tScreenshot\\n-\\tTest result (Passed or not)\\n-\\tLog/evidence tracing possible crashes\\n-\\tAny input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour\\nAnnex A (informative):\\nChange

The source UE sends a Direct Security Mode Complete message to the UE-to-UE Relay, containing its PC5 user plane security policies. This message is protected by Krelay-int or/and Krelay-enc, according to the negotiated PC5 signaling policies between the source UE and the UE-to-UE Relay.\\n\\n2. After successful verification of the Direct Security Mode Complete message, the UE-to-UE Relay stores the 5GPRUK ID in the security context associated with the PC5 link with the source UE. The UE-to-UE Relay then sends a Direct Communication Request message to the target UE, which contains the Relay Service Code to trigger the second hop PC5 link establishment.\\n\\n3. The target UE responds with a Direct Communication Response message to the UE-to-UE Relay, initiating the second hop PC5 security procedure. This message contains the security capabilities and PC5 signaling security policy of the target UE, the PRUK ID (or a SUCI if the target UE does not have a valid PRUK), the Relay Service Code of the UE-to-UE Relay service, and Nonce_1.\\n\\n4. Steps 4b-4d are the same as steps 2b-2d, but with the target UE acting as the source UE. This ensures that both the source UE and target UE establish a secure Layer-3 PC5 link via the UE-to-UE Relay.\\n\\n5. Once the secure Layer-3 PC5 link between the source UE and target UE via the UE-to-UE Relay is established, the UE-to-UE Relay can forward traffic between the peer ProSe UEs.\\n\\nThis procedure fulfills the security requirements and ensures that the user-plane and control-plane messages exchanged between the source and target UEs via the UE-to-UE Relay are integrity protected and confidentiality protected. It is aligned with the SA2's procedure defined in TS 23.304 and can be used regardless of whether the UEs are within or out of network coverage.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":69}],"source":["query1 = \"Secure PC5 link establishment procedure for UE-to-UE Relay\"\n","qa.run(query1)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["[Document(page_content='5G Home Environment Authentication Vector: authentication data consisting of RAND, AUTN, XRES*, and KAUSF for the purpose of authenticating the UE using 5G AKA. \\nNOTE 3a: This vector is received by the AUSF from the UDM/ARPF in the Nudm_Authentication_Get Response.\\n5G Authentication Vector: authentication data consisting of RAND, AUTN, HXRES*, and KSEAF. \\nNOTE 3b: This vector is received by the SEAF from the AUSF in the Nausf_Authentication_Authenticate Response.\\n5G NAS security context: The key KAMF with the associated key set identifier, the UE security capabilities, the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values. \\nNOTE 4:\\tThe distinction between native 5G security context and mapped 5G security context also applies to 5G NAS security contexts.
