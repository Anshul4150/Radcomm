      "3GPP standards have defined frameworks for encrypting application layer traffic based on cryptographic keys derived from USIM (or equivalents such as eSIM). These frameworks can be characterized by a Key Server Function (KSF), located at the home CSP and having a connection to the AAA infrastructure (typically the AUSF). The KSF reuses the basic network layer authentication service (native 5G AKA or EAP-AKA’) to obtain a derived anchor key. From this anchor key, the KSF can derive one or more service specific keys, which can be provided to various application functions. Such an application function provides, besides the application specific functionality,  a Security Termination Function (STF) endpoint for the security with the UE. The KSF uses a 5G native identifier space for subscribers such as SUPI , wheras the STF could in principle use any identifier type to identify its users. Additionally, while the KSF is always located in HPLMN, the STF can be located either in HPLMN, in VPLMN, or even outside a PLMN, e.g. at an enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 5G context, the principles laid out above are currently realized by the Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) based on 3GPP credentials in the 5G System as defined in TS 33.535 [47] and also by legacy frameworks such as the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA), TS 33.220 [48], which is currently undergoing specification for use in the 5GS.\n",

      "NOTE :\tThe terms KSF and STF above are defined for use in the present document, and will in general be realised by network functions specific to a given key management protocol or framework. See clause 7.15.3.1.1 for an example of how these terms are mapped to functions defined by the AKMA framework.\n",

      "7.15.1.2\tLI requirements - overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This clause specifies a common LI architecture for a general CSP-provided key management solution in support of encryption, implemented by generic KSF and STF functionality as defined in clause 7.15.1.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "When encryption keys are provided by a CSP, lawful interception for a target's communication may be done in one of the two ways: (i) decrypt intercepted communication traffic before delivering IRIs and CCs to the LEA, or, (ii) provide to the LEA the decryption keys and other information necessary to enable the decryption of communication traffic. To fully enable decryption of communicaiton traffic, LI functions are in general required both at the KSF and at the STF as illustrated by the following examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXAMPLE 1:\tIn most situations, after STF has obtained encryption key from KSF, the STF has all the necessary information to decrypt the communication traffic without the additional help of KSF.  In this situation, an LI function within the STF can decrypt the target's communication and does not need to provide, explicit encryption-related xIRI.  However, the STF can also have access to xIRI which is not related to encryption, but which is still application specific, and which also can be of relevance to include as part of IRI.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXAMPLE 2:\tIn some situations, STF may not know whether communication traffic is that of a target since it could use a user identfier space which is independent from the 5G identifiers used for LI provisiong. In this situation, the LI function in KSF will have to provide intercept triggers to the LI function in the STF in order to identify the target communication traffic. Moreover, even if decrypted xCC is provided by the STF, the KSF can still typically report xIRI relating to key management (e.g. request for keys from other STFs, expiry of keys etc) which are of relevance for LI. For a third example of applicabity of LI at the KSF, refer to NOTE 3 below.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, the physical/jurisdictional location of KSF and STF can differ depending on the scenario which can have bearing on LI requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE 1:\tWhen a warrant is served to a PLMN that has neither the STF nor the KSF, handling of LI aspects specifically related to the encrypted communication traffic of a target is outside the scope of the present document.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE 2:\tFor roaming situations, where LI providing unencrypted communication in the VPLMN is required, the STF would need to be located in the VPLMN and the STF would also need to use 5G native user identifiers which enable LI provisioning in the VPLMN (since LI can not rely on triggering from HPLMN in this case). However, such roaming scenarios are outside the scope of the present document.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE 3:\tWhen a warrant is issued to a HPLMN that has the KSF, but not the STF, then the LI function in that KSF can still provide encryption related keys and related events to the LEMF. LI at the STF is however then outside the scope of the present document.\n",

      "\n",
      "8.1\tIntroduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The most sensitive information in the LI system is the target list. This is the list of all the subjects in the network currently under surveillance, whether active, suspended or in any other state. The security measures used by the carrier to prevent unauthorized access to this list is not subject to standardization, but the architectural choices made in the design of the LI system do impact the security of the target list directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since completeness of the interception product is a legal requirement in most jurisdictions, the LI system shall ensure that no events that are lawfully authorized for interception are missed (or collected in error). To ensure that no events are missed there are two architectural alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2\tArchitectural alternatives\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2.1\tFull target list at every POI node\n",
      "\n",
      "A carrier may choose to deploy the full target list at all POIs, such that when a UE arrives in the network and commences registration, the POI is fully armed and in position to recognize if the target identifier is in the target list. The choice to push the full list to every node is the simplest, and arguably the riskiest, since the compromise of any node will leak the complete target list.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2.2\tFull target list only in LICF\n",
      "\n",
      "A Communication Service Provider (CSP) may choose to selectively distribute specific target identifiers to specific POIs, rather than distributing the full target list to all POIs. This choice introduces a race condition. When the UE appears, the POI shall query the ADMF/LICF to find out if the user identifier is part of the target list. As the registration sequence progresses, the NF POI is waiting for a response from the ADMF/LICF. When the reply arrives, the POI can take action if the reply is positive. If the reply is negative, the POI's involvement ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the reply is positive, depending on how long the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI round trip for the query/reply took, it is possible that some reportable events are missed. To mitigate this there are two further alternatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) \tthe carrier may choose to delay completion of the registration for all users for the time it takes the ADMF/LICF to answer, thus inducing a registration delay in all registrations, whether the user is a target or not, or\n",
      "\n",
      "2) \tthe carrier may choose to cache the reportable registration events while the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI query is running, and either report them if the answer is positive, or delete them if the answer is negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are choices at the discretion of the CSP, but the trade-off cannot be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.2.3\tProvisioning for registered users\n",
      "\n",
      "When a new target is provisioned in the LI system, after the target is already registered in the CSP network, the CSP will be faced with the race condition consequences of the implementation choice made as described in clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. The ADMF has a choice to either wholesale pre-arm every POI with the new target (and expect every POI to immediately start interception on the new target, as in clause 8.2.1), or, the ADMF can poll every serving UDM POI for all target UEs, and arm the associated POI (and start interception, as in clause 8.1.2) only if a target UE is discovered to be served by that particular NF. The second approach would take comparatively longer and would be expected to miss more of the on-going target interactions with the network than the first approach.\n",

The presence of multiple Identity header fields within a SIP INVITE request raises the prospect that a verification service could receive a message containing both valid and invalid Identity header fields. As a guideline, RFC 8224 [40] recommends that only if a verifier determines that all Identity header fields within a message are invalid should the request be considered to have an invalid identity. If at least one Identity header field value is valid and from a trusted source, then relying parties can use that header for authorization decisions regardless of whether other untrusted or invalid Identity headers appear in a request.\n",

In these scenarios, usage of STIR/SHAKEN is very similar to that for voice sessions.\n",

An Identity header could be added to any SIP MESSAGE request, but without some extension to the PASSporT claims, the PASSporT would offer no protection to the message content. In IETF draft-ietf-stir-messaging-07 [46], PASSporT provides its own integrity check for message contents as part of its assertions through a new claim which is here defined to provide a hash over message contents. A new \"msg\" PASSporT Type is defined for that purpose. A new optional claim \"msgi\" provides a digest over a MIME body (i.e. body of the SIP MESSAGE). The PASSporT is conveyed in an Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request. The authentication and verification service procedures for populating that PASSporT follow the same procedures as for a voice session, with the addition of the \"msgi\" claim.\n",

To achieve this the LI Function shall after instantiation and initial network configuration by NFV MANO (e.g. allocation of network IP address and FQDN) contact the LIPF over the LI_X0 interface and LIPF will notify the LICF that a new potential LI function has contacted the LIPF. The LIPF shall only accept incoming connections from new LI functions that have previously been notified to the LIPF/LICF by the LI NFV controller over LI_NO.

The LICF is responsible for providing necessary information and policy rules necessary for the LIPF to perform configuration of LI functions over LI_X0. For the purposes of instantiation IEFs and ICF follow the same instantiation flow as POIs except that the LIPF has a more limited role in managing these functions after instantiation over LI_XEM1 compared to POIs as neither of these types of LI functions are subject to LI provisioning.\n",

The same applies to virtualised MDFs or CC-PAG.\n",
      "Once an LI function directly associated with or embedded in an NF has been made fully ready for provisioning over LI_X1 using LI_X0, the LICF in the ADMF via the LIPF shall notify the LI NFV Controller that the LI function is ready for service and NFV MANO may advise the OSS/BSS that the NF associated with the LI functions is ready for service and discovery by the NRF. For MDFs, CC-PAGs, or non-embedded POIs the LICF may still need to provide a ready for service indication to NFV MANO / OSS / BSS depending on the implementation scenario.\n",

      "3GPP standards have defined frameworks for encrypting application layer traffic based on cryptographic keys derived from USIM (or equivalents such as eSIM). These frameworks can be characterized by a Key Server Function (KSF), located at the home CSP and having a connection to the AAA infrastructure (typically the AUSF). The KSF reuses the basic network layer authentication service (native 5G AKA or EAP-AKA’) to obtain a derived anchor key. From this anchor key, the KSF can derive one or more service specific keys, which can be provided to various application functions. Such an application function provides, besides the application specific functionality,  a Security Termination Function (STF) endpoint for the security with the UE. The KSF uses a 5G native identifier space for subscribers such as SUPI , wheras the STF could in principle use any identifier type to identify its users. Additionally, while the KSF is always located in HPLMN, the STF can be located either in HPLMN, in VPLMN, or even outside a PLMN, e.g. at an enterprise.\n",
      "In 5G context, the principles laid out above are currently realized by the Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) based on 3GPP credentials in the 5G System as defined in TS 33.535 [47] and also by legacy frameworks such as the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA), TS 33.220 [48], which is currently undergoing specification for use in the 5GS.\n",
      "NOTE :\tThe terms KSF and STF above are defined for use in the present document, and will in general be realised by network functions specific to a given key management protocol or framework. See clause 7.15.3.1.1 for an example of how these terms are mapped to functions defined by the AKMA framework.\n",
      "7.15.1.2\tLI requirements - overview\n",
      "This clause specifies a common LI architecture for a general CSP-provided key management solution in support of encryption, implemented by generic KSF and STF functionality as defined in clause 7.15.1.1.\n",
      "When encryption keys are provided by a CSP, lawful interception for a target's communication may be done in one of the two ways: (i) decrypt intercepted communication traffic before delivering IRIs and CCs to the LEA, or, (ii) provide to the LEA the decryption keys and other information necessary to enable the decryption of communication traffic. To fully enable decryption of communicaiton traffic, LI functions are in general required both at the KSF and at the STF as illustrated by the following examples.\n",
      "EXAMPLE 1:\tIn most situations, after STF has obtained encryption key from KSF, the STF has all the necessary information to decrypt the communication traffic without the additional help of KSF.  In this situation, an LI function within the STF can decrypt the target's communication and does not need to provide, explicit encryption-related xIRI.  However, the STF can also have access to xIRI which is not related to encryption, but which is still application specific, and which also can be of relevance to include as part of IRI.\n",
      "EXAMPLE 2:\tIn some situations, STF may not know whether communication traffic is that of a target since it could use a user identfier space which is independent from the 5G identifiers used for LI provisiong. In this situation, the LI function in KSF will have to provide intercept triggers to the LI function in the STF in order to identify the target communication traffic. Moreover, even if decrypted xCC is provided by the STF, the KSF can still typically report xIRI relating to key management (e.g. request for keys from other STFs, expiry of keys etc) which are of relevance for LI. For a third example of applicabity of LI at the KSF, refer to NOTE 3 below.\n",
      "As mentioned, the physical/jurisdictional location of KSF and STF can differ depending on the scenario which can have bearing on LI requirements.\n",
      "NOTE 1:\tWhen a warrant is served to a PLMN that has neither the STF nor the KSF, handling of LI aspects specifically related to the encrypted communication traffic of a target is outside the scope of the present document.\n",
      "NOTE 2:\tFor roaming situations, where LI providing unencrypted communication in the VPLMN is required, the STF would need to be located in the VPLMN and the STF would also need to use 5G native user identifiers which enable LI provisioning in the VPLMN (since LI can not rely on triggering from HPLMN in this case). However, such roaming scenarios are outside the scope of the present document.\n",
      "NOTE 3:\tWhen a warrant is issued to a HPLMN that has the KSF, but not the STF, then the LI function in that KSF can still provide encryption related keys and related events to the LEMF. LI at the STF is however then outside the scope of the present document.\n",
      "To summarize, with respect to the LI at KSF and STF, three specific type of xIRIs are identified:\n",
      "1.\txIRI from KSF consting of key managment information such as decryption keys and thereto related information.\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "8.1\tIntroduction\n",
      "The most sensitive information in the LI system is the target list. This is the list of all the subjects in the network currently under surveillance, whether active, suspended or in any other state. The security measures used by the carrier to prevent unauthorized access to this list is not subject to standardization, but the architectural choices made in the design of the LI system do impact the security of the target list directly.\n",
      "Since completeness of the interception product is a legal requirement in most jurisdictions, the LI system shall ensure that no events that are lawfully authorized for interception are missed (or collected in error). To ensure that no events are missed there are two architectural alternatives.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "8.2\tArchitectural alternatives\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "8.2.1\tFull target list at every POI node\n",
      "A carrier may choose to deploy the full target list at all POIs, such that when a UE arrives in the network and commences registration, the POI is fully armed and in position to recognize if the target identifier is in the target list. The choice to push the full list to every node is the simplest, and arguably the riskiest, since the compromise of any node will leak the complete target list.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "8.2.2\tFull target list only in LICF\n",
      "A Communication Service Provider (CSP) may choose to selectively distribute specific target identifiers to specific POIs, rather than distributing the full target list to all POIs. This choice introduces a race condition. When the UE appears, the POI shall query the ADMF/LICF to find out if the user identifier is part of the target list. As the registration sequence progresses, the NF POI is waiting for a response from the ADMF/LICF. When the reply arrives, the POI can take action if the reply is positive. If the reply is negative, the POI's involvement ends.\n",
      "If the reply is positive, depending on how long the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI round trip for the query/reply took, it is possible that some reportable events are missed. To mitigate this there are two further alternatives:\n",
      "1) \tthe carrier may choose to delay completion of the registration for all users for the time it takes the ADMF/LICF to answer, thus inducing a registration delay in all registrations, whether the user is a target or not, or\n",
      "2) \tthe carrier may choose to cache the reportable registration events while the POI-(ADMF/LICF)-POI query is running, and either report them if the answer is positive, or delete them if the answer is negative.\n",
      "These are choices at the discretion of the CSP, but the trade-off cannot be avoided.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "8.2.3\tProvisioning for registered users\n",
      "When a new target is provisioned in the LI system, after the target is already registered in the CSP network, the CSP will be faced with the race condition consequences of the implementation choice made as described in clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. The ADMF has a choice to either wholesale pre-arm every POI with the new target (and expect every POI to immediately start interception on the new target, as in clause 8.2.1), or, the ADMF can poll every serving UDM POI for all target UEs, and arm the associated POI (and start interception, as in clause 8.1.2) only if a target UE is discovered to be served by that particular NF. The second approach would take comparatively longer and would be expected to miss more of the on-going target interactions with the network than the first approach.\n",

The POI may be embedded in the NF or external to the NF, connected to its interfaces. The choice of one, the other, or both approaches is service specific.\n",

In large message mode, the contents of the message are not inserted into the SIP message but carried using MSRP as defined in RFC 4975 [36] and RFC 6714 [37].

      "STIR provides the ability within SIP to authenticate caller ID, and SHAKEN defines the end-to-end architecture to implement caller ID authentication using STIR in the telephone network.\n",
      "STIR/SHAKEN uses digital certificates, based on common public key cryptography techniques, to ensure the calling number of a telephony session is secure. Each telephone service provider obtains its digital certificates from a trusted certificate authority. The certificate technology enables verifying that the calling number is accurate and has not been spoofed.\n",

The \"application server (AS) for signing\" is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function of the authentication service defined in RFC 8224 [40] for originating number identity and in RFC 8946 [41] for diverting number identity. The \"AS for verification\" is an HTTP-based application server that performs the function of the verification service defined in RFC 8224 [40] and in RFC 8946 [41]. Certificate Repository (CR) represents the publicly accessible store for public key certificates.\n",
      "Either the Telephony AS or IBCF in the originating service provider’s network invokes the AS for signing which creates a digital signature for the call called a PASSportT (Personal Assertion Token) assigned to a SIP Identity header. The IBCF or Telephony AS in the terminating service provider’s network invokes the AS for verification which verifies the digital signature of the call. The AS includes a VERSTAT parameter in the P-Asserted-Identity or From header of the SIP INVITE request, with possible values of TN-Validation-Passed, TN-Validation-Failed or No-TN-Validation.\n",
      "A SIP INVITE request might have one Identity added by an authentication service at the originating administrative domain and then other Identity header fields added by some further intermediaries. The presence of multiple Identity header fields within a SIP INVITE request raises the prospect that a verification service could receive a message containing both valid and invalid Identity header fields. As a guideline, RFC 8224 [40] recommends that only if a verifier determines that all Identity header fields within a message are invalid should the request be considered to have an invalid identity. If at least one Identity header field value is valid and from a trusted source, then relying parties can use that header for authorization decisions regardless of whether other untrusted or invalid Identity headers appear in a request.\n",

      "A PASSporT could be used to securely negotiate a session over which messages will be exchanged; this is applicable for example to the following RCS services: large message mode standalone messaging, 1-to-1 chat and group chat where messages are exchanged using MSRP (Message Session Relay Protocol) after the SIP ssession is established. In these scenarios, usage of STIR/SHAKEN is very similar to that for voice sessions.\n",
      "In sessionless scenarios such as RCS pager mode standalone messaging service, a PASSporT could be generated on a per-message (i.e. SIP MESSAGE) basis with its own built-in message security. An Identity header could be added to any SIP MESSAGE request, but without some extension to the PASSporT claims, the PASSporT would offer no protection to the message content. In IETF draft-ietf-stir-messaging-07 [46], PASSporT provides its own integrity check for message contents as part of its assertions through a new claim which is here defined to provide a hash over message contents. A new \"msg\" PASSporT Type is defined for that purpose. A new optional claim \"msgi\" provides a digest over a MIME body (i.e. body of the SIP MESSAGE). The PASSporT is conveyed in an Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request. The authentication and verification service procedures for populating that PASSporT follow the same procedures as for a voice session, with the addition of the \"msgi\" claim.\n",

Intermediate providers transiting calls with TDM signaling only do not use Out-of-Band SHAKEN. An upstream provider would have already published PASSporTs for those calls to a CPS. There is no need for an all-TDM intermediate provider to do anything as shown in figure E.3.4-2.

RFC 8946 [41] extends the SIP identity token (i.e. PASSporT) with an explicit indication that the original called number no longer reflects the destination to which a call is intended to be delivered via a \"div\" parameter. It indicates a previous destination for a session during its routing process. When a retargeting entity receives a call signed with the SIP Identity token, it may act as an authentication service and create a new SIP Identity token containing the “div” parameter to attach to the session.\n",

The second category is a set of RCD that is defined as part of the jCard (JSON format for vCard) as specified in RFC 7095 [43]. RCD is inserted in the SIP Identity header token and is digitally signed. If a session is not authenticated and signed then RCD cannot be used. While RCD can be provided by an originating authentication service, an intermediary in the session path could also acquire RCD by querying a third-party service. Such a service effectively acts as a STIR authentication service, generating its own Identity token including RCD, and that token could be attached to a SIP session by either the originating or terminating side.\n",
