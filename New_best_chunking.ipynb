      "\n",
      "The present document has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to standardise Lawful Interception of telecommunications. The present document describes protocols and procedures for Lawful Interception based on 3GPP specifications. These protocols and procedures cover both internal 3GPP interfaces (those required to intercept communications and manage interception within a 3GPP network) and external handover interfaces (those used for delivery of intercepted communications to Law Enforcement, or handling of warrants).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawful Interception needs to be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Such national laws and regulations define the extent to which capabilities in the present document are applicable in specific jurisdictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\tScope\n",
      "\n",
      "The present document specifies the protocols and procedures required to perform Lawful Interception within a 3GPP network. The present document addresses both internal interfaces used internally with a 3GPP network and external handover interfaces used to handover intercepted communications to law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present document describes the detailed targeting of communications in each point of interception within a 3GPP network and the information that a point of interception needs to be able to capture. Furthermore, the detailed data formats for both the internal and external interfaces are also defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "National regulations determine the applicable set of information that needs to be handed over or excluded from handover to law enforcement for a given 3GPP operator service.\n",
      "\n",

      "The present document has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to standardise Lawful Interception of telecommunications. The present document describes protocols and procedures for Lawful Interception based on 3GPP specifications. These protocols and procedures cover both internal 3GPP interfaces (those required to intercept communications and manage interception within a 3GPP network) and external handover interfaces (those used for delivery of intercepted communications to Law Enforcement, or handling of warrants).\n",
      "Lawful Interception needs to be done in accordance with the applicable national or regional laws and technical regulations. Such national laws and regulations define the extent to which capabilities in the present document are applicable in specific jurisdictions.\n",

      "The present document specifies the protocols and procedures required to perform Lawful Interception within a 3GPP network. The present document addresses both internal interfaces used internally with a 3GPP network and external handover interfaces used to handover intercepted communications to law enforcement.\n",
      "The present document describes the detailed targeting of communications in each point of interception within a 3GPP network and the information that a point of interception needs to be able to capture. Furthermore, the detailed data formats for both the internal and external interfaces are also defined.\n",
      "National regulations determine the applicable set of information that needs to be handed over or excluded from handover to law enforcement for a given 3GPP operator service.\n",
